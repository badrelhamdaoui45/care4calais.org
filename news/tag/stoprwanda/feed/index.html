					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we had some truly brilliant news. Kamal, a 22-year-old Sudanese refugee whose been in detention for two months under threat of being sent to Rwanda, has finally been freed. For two months Kamal has lived in constant fear and anxiety as he worried about was going to happen to him. He knows of atrocities committed by the regime in Rwanda, and even now he’s been released, the thought of being sent there makes him physically shake.  It will probably give him nightmares for months. “I spent 18 months travelling through Africa trying to find a way out. In every country I’ve been beaten, robbed and treated as sub-human, so why on Earth would I want to go back to Rwanda?” Being free feels wonderful, he says, but he still feels weak, and his ordeal as a refugee isn’t over yet, because he still has to go through his asylum claim. But at least now he can begin to think about beginning his life again. He is so polite with such a big smile and an excellent sense of humour, and we really hope that he has a good, safe future ahead of him. His problems began in Darfur many years ago – pretty much from the day he was born. “The problems in Darfur aren’t just because of the war. It’s always been hard for blacks. The Arabs of the north treat us like animals and make life very tough. We cannot find jobs or finish our education, and university is almost impossible. Even just walking down the street is dangerous – they will stop you and beat you and take your phone or anything you may have. If you won’t give it to them they will use a gun to force you. In Darfur there is no hope, no future, no peace and no safety. “Sudanese people are beautiful, they are so kind and peaceful but there is nothing for us. It is controlled by the north and we are treated like slaves. “I was from a large family and there was never enough money. I used to help my mum in whatever work we could find. It was always low-level work in the markets, moving things and selling things. We would do anything to get money to eat. “After primary school I was denied education but later when I was 18 or 19 I started to join campaigns to demand education and to be allowed to go to college. We demonstrated outside the university even though the police beat us and put us in jail. “Gradually I realised  things would only get worse and I’d never have a chance to learn. With some others we decided to leave and so in December 2020 I started my journey. “We began by heading into Chad. That was better than the desert to Libya, but still not good. There was a war there, so it was a dangerous place for us. We looked for a small town to find a job, but we couldn’t find work anywhere. Finally we heard about some men who were digging for gold somewhere between Libya and Niger, so we went there. “The digging was hard work outside in the sun, but after a long search we found rocks containing gold and dug them out. Some other experienced men took the good rocks away to be cleaned and washed, so the gold could be extracted. They told us we had found a good place and to keep working. But after two months hard work they refused to pay us. “By then we had nothing, and we were forced to continue work. We worked many hours with no rests and so little food. The hammers we used weighed 10 kilos and it was so hot. I didn’t think I could survive so I planned to escape. “Four of us escaped. We split up so they could not find us easily, and I went into Niger to look for a job. There was nothing, though, no jobs and no money. After some time I decided  I had to go to Libya; I was lucky there I suppose, as I was never caught and put in prison, but I think that’s  maybe because I had such a bad time digging the gold. “I found a smuggler and persuaded him to take what little money I had and let me on a boat. The boat headed to Lampedusa, but it took four days to get there, and the journey was very scary. There was no food or water on the boat and the waves were very high; by the fourth day the boat was finished, and the waves were crashing down on it making it sink. Luckily we were near the island by now and could get a network signal. A boat came to rescue us and took us to shore. “I tried to get a train to Rome with my friend but we couldn’t afford tickets and we kept getting caught. But then an Italian lady helped us – she bought us tickets to Rome and took us to her house to sleep and to eat. You find kindness when you least expect it. “From Rome we went to Ventimiglia, but again I had no money for a smuggler. There were lots of guys living under a bridge there and a charity that gave us food and water. Some of these guys were getting a car to France with a smuggler. It was only $40 to pay but I didn’t even have that, but I managed to get in unnoticed. I wasn’t found and got to France. “From the border I travelled to Marseille and then Paris. In Paris I had to sleep on the street for two days, I had no phone and no money. Again I found a kind man who lent me his phone so I could call my friends to make a plan. We decided to meet in Calais to try to cross [&#8230;]</p>

Again I found a kind man who lent me his phone so I could call my friends to make a plan. We decided to meet in Calais to try to cross to the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I was in Calais for nearly 10 months. It was a very hard time, and I had to rely on charities for everything. I had no money and I tried so many times to get across on the lorries and by boat. One time a French police officer who had caught me lots of times told me, “if I see you again, you will not be alive to try any more.” So I hid for about a month and did not try. Then in June this year I met a group of people who had paid for a boat and when they ran to the sea with it I ran with them, and no one noticed or pushed me out, and I got across.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I was in some place for three days and then taken to a detention centre called Brook House, where I got the letter for Rwanda. It was a horrible time, after everything they were going to send me back to Africa. I could not go back; I love my homeland but it’s not safe. I became very miserable. So it was a great relief when I found out Care4Calais were going to help me.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m in Liverpool – well, Runcorn actually. I like it here and I’ve met some lovely volunteers. But I want to move on. I want to get my education now and become a teacher. Education makes the difference in how people are treated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“To others going through a journey like mine I would say don’t give up. Just keep fighting, cross all the barriers you find, take a chance and do it with a brave and proud heart. I am glad I am here – but I don’t feel safe yet.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In just two weeks we will be back in court to challenge the lawfulness of the Government’s cruel Rwanda policy. To have any chance of stopping this, the time to act is now. We’ve recently learned that the Foreign Office warned Priti Patel that refugees should not be sent to Rwanda due to human rights concerns, including that they could be forced to join the country’s army and sent to fight in neighbouring states. Following this disclosure, the Government has been ordered by the court to deliver more documents next week that had previously been redacted. What else could they be hiding? This policy is brutal beyond words and, as we gear up to support another group of terrified refugees, the memories of the last attempted flight haunt us: suicide attempts, self harm, hunger strikes and distraught relatives. The thought of facing it again is weakening. We need your help to remind the public why this policy must be stopped. Here are some easy things you can do: 1. Write to your local newspaper. This is a great way to raise awareness! We provide a template letter and can help you to get it sent =&#62; bit.ly/RWDwrite 2. Campaign at home or at work. For lots of easy ideas =&#62; bit.ly/RWDcmpn 3. Go to a demo or join us at the Notting Hill Carnival =&#62; bit.ly/RWDdemo 4. Support the campaign on social media =&#62; bit.ly/RWDsocial 5. Please share this post! Thank you 🙏</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Your emotions are always up and down when you work with refugees, but today I had a moment that was so bittersweet it set my head reeling. A young Sudanese refugee I&#8217;d been helping sent me a message that made my spirits soar. Having been through hell at home and on his journey, he&#8217;d been granted leave to remain for five years, and had finally accessed the medical treatment he had waited so long for. &#8220;First of all I want say thank you very much for standing with me in difficult time,&#8221; he wrote &#8220;I will never forget your help and I have good news, I get my documents and second thing I&#8217;m completely cured. All credit goes to the doctors and to you for your mighty stance I&#8217;m very grateful for you thanks 🥰 &#8220;U make feel I have someone standing with me.&#8221; Wonderful news, of course. He can start to rebuild his life, and to study too. It’s all he ever talks about. He’s a really smart kid and he’s been through a lot. His father, uncle and brother were all part of the revolution against the dictator Omar Al-Bashir who has been charged with genocide and war crimes. They were all killed during the revolution and he was left alone at 16. He made his own long and dangerous journey to the UK having read about it in book, and with an untreated injury he sustained in Sudan. He’s quiet, smart and very brave too. But now the Nationality and Borders Bill is in force it hit me like a blow that from now on boys like him will arrive in our country, thinking they will finally be safe, only to face the ruthless new world of UK immigration policy. My young friend got leave to remain for five years because he arrived before the bill passed. The best those arriving now can hope for is temporary protection – meaning that they will never really feel safe, so they cannot heal and begin to build a new life. And what is asylum if it’s not safety? The Government have pulled a neat trick. They haven’t ‘changed the rules’. They are ending UK asylum for the vast majority of refugees. Our leaders have quietly brought about a truly momentous change. And people like my young friend &#8211; the only surviving family of men brave enough to stand up to a war criminal &#8211; will pay the price. For centuries, our approach to asylum was based on showing empathy for people who needed it, and respecting their human rights. In the new world, it seems, we will think only of ourselves. And we will not only be indifferent to other people&#8217;s suffering, we will exploit and intensify it in grotesque pantomimes of detainment and deportation &#8211; chiefly to appease the beliefs of a small number of people whose votes are being courted. It is a dark vision of the future, and we have to resist it. As I did today, we must remember more people have empathy and compassion than do not, and that this change can be resisted if we work together. We must do it for the sake of all the people like my friend Sudan. For all those who seek only safety and a little help as they remake their lives. For all those who need to feel they have someone standing with them in a difficult time 🥰 To help go to care4calais.org/stop-Rwanda</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; Yesterday was the most incredible day of action with volunteers, activists and trade unionists across the country coming together to show their opposition to the Government’s brutal Rwanda plan. Protests took place at Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival, Nottingham, Coventry , Dudley, Cambridge, Norwich, Manchester, Portsmouth, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Shrewesbury, Harlow, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham, Stoke and elsewhere, called as part of the #StopRwanda campaign, launched by the Trades Union Congress, Care4Calais and Stand Up To Racism, and backed by eleven trade unions including the PCS. This was an incredible display of what we can achieve when we come together. It was fantastic to see the photos and videos pouring in from round the country of so many people taking action to show how strong their feelings are about this cruel plan. We have six weeks to show the Government there are more effective and compassion alternatives to the Rwanda plan.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday was the most incredible day of action with volunteers, activists and trade unionists across the country coming together to show their opposition to the Government’s brutal Rwanda plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests took place at Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival, Nottingham, Coventry , Dudley, Cambridge, Norwich, Manchester, Portsmouth, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Shrewesbury, Harlow, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham, Stoke and elsewhere, called as part of the</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stoprwanda?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZVDD5KWvgwrzto8uwst42ceAISB-Dp4hj1sdEq9hcRwhuD-Cd8CGpMS_ByD_FUJPnuhPhBuwGJzNDcQy2B3ovwW7oO5G8SDtMv3JRYI8B5X5DdLMkD-QIVcVP8FtrxbKMudtFONP0HPzla4iifPynJrMVqvA42qtjtPZBb8l1GqSfeLyFFDPWgaY5agVT6SfIGi2df7TqIil7vQQKKDkCa_&amp;__tn__=*NK-R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> #StopRwanda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign, launched by the Trades Union Congress, Care4Calais and Stand Up To Racism, and backed by eleven trade unions including the PCS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an incredible display of what we can achieve when we come together. It was fantastic to see the photos and videos pouring in from round the country of so many people taking action to show how strong their feelings are about this cruel plan.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; This #StopRwanda sign was sent to us by a refugee in Calais. Its simplicity is incredibly moving – and a reminder that the refugees who will be affected by this barbaric Rwanda plan are only seeking safety. We&#8217;re receiving pictures from places all around the world now, the sheer numbers of people showing the sheer scale of opposition to the UK Government&#8217;s callous scheme. People everywhere are united in demanding that the flights are stopped and the whole idea replaced with a plan for refugees that is sensible and humane. It was great news that our court case against the plan has been adjourned to September, giving us more time to build the campaign and show people&#8217;s refusal to accept the plan. Right now we’re using all the support we&#8217;ve been getting for the campaign to make as much as noise as possible, to make sure the Government knows the strength of public opposition. In September we will be in the High Court to challenge the lawfulness of the plan, and in the run up to that date we need your support. Here&#8217;s what you can do to help: Download or make a #StopRwanda card and take picture of yourself and/or your friends holding it. Post the pic on your social channels and tag us @care4calais =&#62; bit.ly/RWDbanner Download the icon and save it as your profile picture on social media =&#62; bit.ly/RWDicon Buy your t shirt, take a photo, post it on socials, wear it out and about, talk about it and wear it to the demo! =&#62; https://bit.ly/RWDtee For more info and details of other actions you can take go to care4calais.org/stop-rwanda/</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; Today we were making friendship bracelets whilst on distribution in Calais, and a small group of guys from Sudan came over and started thinking about the colours they could use and what sort of style they&#8217;d like. We made various suggestions, but one of them laughed and said no, no and then he thought for a bit and said, I know, I want a Bob Marley – one, red gold and green. Bob Marley is always popular with the guys here and you sometimes hear them talk about him. Anyway, they were soon deep in quiet concentration weaving /plaiting the bands, making sure they kept them neat and straight. Two of them were working on a Bob-inspired design whilst another made a slimmer one using the red and white colours inspired by the Sudanese flag. We&#8217;ve been offering friendship-bracelet-making on the bike stall for a few weeks now. In a way it might not seem a big deal to someone looking in from the outside but when you don&#8217;t have much, small things can have a bigger meanings, and this is a way of interacting with people, talking about something different apart from the daily grind of life as a refugee in Calais. That little bit of self-expression makes a difference. The refugees and volunteers enjoy it &#8211; It usually takes an hour or so to make a bracelet, you can do it together without knowing much of each others language, and its nice that there&#8217;s something physical at the end of it. The support we provide isn&#8217;t just about basic necessities, friendship is a big part of it too, and these small bracelets are little symbols of that. As we finished up a nice fat Marley-esque number today. it made us all consider what else we could do and I plan to get a few more colours to bring back next week. Maybe we should get some black and white to get working on some #StopRwanda versions!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; It&#8217;s amazing to see all the pictures we&#8217;re getting of people with #StopRwanda signs, showing just how huge opposition to the Government&#8217;s cruel scheme is. People of all ages and backgrounds in every corner of the country are clearly united in demanding that the flights are stopped and the whole idea replaced with a plan for refugees that is sensible and humane. It was great news that our court case against the plan has been adjourned to September, giving us more time to build the campaign and show people&#8217;s refusal to accept the plan. Right now we’re using all the support we&#8217;ve been getting for the campaign to make as much as noise as possible, to make sure the Government knows the strength of public opposition.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s amazing to see all the pictures we&#8217;re getting of people with</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stoprwanda?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZXuk-2QXOT3QCWInvMEzG3cn-Kha44LqM3dSLDRLtDZ2wZgbwAiu3USDxMdtrbXKayH6cYEkoHE77fQYn7Uu-wC-DOUPyxl3vU_vvmmsgJZeoB9IPBhX2Gn_tHU04NFidH42mTJv7uhCwsOOitrr0ARmlQ6SDQWv-M_6_lvmDs7fVDErNy3HwcJwbD4TZaIaSqW_ku-uG7gZ9bRAqoEJcuq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> #StopRwanda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signs, showing just how huge opposition to the Government&#8217;s cruel scheme is. People of all ages and backgrounds in every corner of the country are clearly united in demanding that the flights are stopped and the whole idea replaced with a plan for refugees that is sensible and humane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was great news that our court case against the plan has been adjourned to September, giving us more time to build the campaign and show people&#8217;s refusal to accept the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now we’re using all the support we&#8217;ve been getting for the campaign to make as much as noise as possible, to make sure the Government knows the strength of public opposition. On 5 September we will be in the High Court to challenge the lawfulness of the plan, and in the run up to that date we need your support.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Breaking: Rwanda case adjourned Good news! We are pleased to report that the Divisional Court has granted our application for an adjournment of the Rwanda case until September. However the Government has refused to rule out flights in the interim, before the lawfulness of the policy is determined by the courts. We are currently working with more than 20 people who have been detained and issued with Rwanda notices since the last court case, and many of those from before remain detained, exhausted and alone, and terrified for what the future might bring. They have suffered some of the very worst things that can happen on this planet. They have appalling physical and mental scars, and now face the threat of further extreme trauma. Some have now been in detention more than six weeks and urgently need to be released. The Rwanda plan is brutal. Given the more humane and effective options available is this really what we as a compassionate country want to do? We have been overwhelmed by the public support we have received so far but it’s essential that we keep the pressure up. We still have only seven weeks until we will be in court to fight against this cruel plan. To see how you can help please go to care4calais.org/stop-Rwanda</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>On 19 July we will be back in court to determine whether the Government’s Rwanda plan is lawful. This will be an incredibly important case for the future refugee rights in the UK. Our lawyers will argue: &#8211; There is compelling evidence, provided by UNHCR, that Rwanda is not a safe country for refugees. &#8211; There is a risk that refugees human rights may be breached in Rwanda. &#8211; It is against international refugee law to penalise refugees for their unlawful arrival in a country. &#8211; UNHCR have provided evidence that asylum seekers will not get a fair hearing in Rwanda. &#8211; The procedure that has been used to decide to send people to Rwanda may not have been fair. We are currently working with 24 people who have been detained and issued with notices since the last court case, and many of those from last time still remain in detention now. We heard today that the first woman has been detained and issued with a Rwanda notice. We also understand that a second flight is now being prepared, a source of great fear for all those at risk. We need your help to show the Government this is not what British people want. Please act now. Here’s what you can do: Download the icon and save it as your profile picture on social media =&#62; bit.ly/RWDicon Download or make a #StopRwanda card and take picture of yourself and/or your friends holding it. Post the pic on your social channels and tag us @care4calais, and send your pic to us stoprwanda@care4calais.org =&#62; bit.ly/RWDbanner Buy your t shirt, take a photo, post it on socials, wear it out and about, talk about it and wear it to the demo! =&#62; https://bit.ly/RWDtee Make sure you repost any social media posts again on 19 July using the #StopRwanda hashtag. 19 July is the day we most need to be heard! Demonstrate When: Tuesday 19 July, 9am to 5pm Where: Outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London WC2A 2LL There will be further demos around the country.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; On Tuesday 19 July we’re going back to court to challenge this Government’s barbaric plan to send refugees to Rwanda. The hearing will decide whether the Rwanda policy itself is lawful. In the days leading up to the 19th, it’s vital that we all pull together to fight this disgraceful scheme. The legal challenge, and the protests that took place last month week were so important in stopping the horror of refugees being sent to Rwanda on the government’s first scheduled flight. We MUST keep up the pressure and show of opposition. There will be a demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London between 9 am &#8211; 5 pm with a rally at 2 pm. Please attend if you can. This demonstration is called jointly by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Care4Calais, and Stand Up To Racism and supported by unions including PCS Union, UNISON, Unite the union, @National GeographicEducation, GMB Union, The Communication Workers Union, Fire Brigades Union, NASUWT, ASLEF &#8211; The UK Train Drivers&#8217; Union, UCU &#8211; University and College Union National Education Union and Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union &#8211; BFAWU, as well as Refugee Council, @Citizenship Coalition, Amnesty International, StatusNow4All. We call on local areas outside of London to hold protests on Saturday 16 July too. For details of the demo, go here: fb.me/e/3owNekq2X</p>
