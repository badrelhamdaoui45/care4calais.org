					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today in Calais I talked to Ali, a 20-year-old refugee who was so confused and frightened by the news from the UK that it broke my heart. &#160; Ali had spent all weekend reading about the Illegal Migration Bill becoming law. “Why doesn’t the UK want me?” He asked. “Why don’t they understand?” &#160; Ali fled Sudan when his family were killed, and he knew he would be killed too if the militia found him. All he wants is to be safe. But now he’s in an impossible situation. In France, the police take his tent every few days. He thinks if he goes to the UK, he will be imprisoned in a barge or sent to Rwanda. “I can&#8217;t go to Libya because I was kidnapped and kept in prison there. I can&#8217;t go back to Sudan because they might kill me.” He was close to tears. “Where can I go?” he said. “Tell me, where can I go?” &#160; All the volunteers in Calais have been shocked by the huge amount of difficult conversations we’ve had with refugees this weekend. The people we support here in Calais are terrified. &#160; Everyday you hear stories from people of the violence, persecution and suffering they have escaped in their home country. You hear about dangerous journeys they have made to reach Europe. In France, many have been harassed and abused simply for being refugees. &#160; Despite all of this, they are even more scared of what will happen now because of the new law in the UK. &#160; Because of this, people in Calais are taking even more risks to get to the UK before these laws are acted upon.
