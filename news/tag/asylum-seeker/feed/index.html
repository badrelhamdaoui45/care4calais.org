					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we had some truly brilliant news. Kamal, a 22-year-old Sudanese refugee whose been in detention for two months under threat of being sent to Rwanda, has finally been freed. For two months Kamal has lived in constant fear and anxiety as he worried about was going to happen to him. He knows of atrocities committed by the regime in Rwanda, and even now he’s been released, the thought of being sent there makes him physically shake.  It will probably give him nightmares for months. “I spent 18 months travelling through Africa trying to find a way out. In every country I’ve been beaten, robbed and treated as sub-human, so why on Earth would I want to go back to Rwanda?” Being free feels wonderful, he says, but he still feels weak, and his ordeal as a refugee isn’t over yet, because he still has to go through his asylum claim. But at least now he can begin to think about beginning his life again. He is so polite with such a big smile and an excellent sense of humour, and we really hope that he has a good, safe future ahead of him. His problems began in Darfur many years ago – pretty much from the day he was born. “The problems in Darfur aren’t just because of the war. It’s always been hard for blacks. The Arabs of the north treat us like animals and make life very tough. We cannot find jobs or finish our education, and university is almost impossible. Even just walking down the street is dangerous – they will stop you and beat you and take your phone or anything you may have. If you won’t give it to them they will use a gun to force you. In Darfur there is no hope, no future, no peace and no safety. “Sudanese people are beautiful, they are so kind and peaceful but there is nothing for us. It is controlled by the north and we are treated like slaves. “I was from a large family and there was never enough money. I used to help my mum in whatever work we could find. It was always low-level work in the markets, moving things and selling things. We would do anything to get money to eat. “After primary school I was denied education but later when I was 18 or 19 I started to join campaigns to demand education and to be allowed to go to college. We demonstrated outside the university even though the police beat us and put us in jail. “Gradually I realised  things would only get worse and I’d never have a chance to learn. With some others we decided to leave and so in December 2020 I started my journey. “We began by heading into Chad. That was better than the desert to Libya, but still not good. There was a war there, so it was a dangerous place for us. We looked for a small town to find a job, but we couldn’t find work anywhere. Finally we heard about some men who were digging for gold somewhere between Libya and Niger, so we went there. “The digging was hard work outside in the sun, but after a long search we found rocks containing gold and dug them out. Some other experienced men took the good rocks away to be cleaned and washed, so the gold could be extracted. They told us we had found a good place and to keep working. But after two months hard work they refused to pay us. “By then we had nothing, and we were forced to continue work. We worked many hours with no rests and so little food. The hammers we used weighed 10 kilos and it was so hot. I didn’t think I could survive so I planned to escape. “Four of us escaped. We split up so they could not find us easily, and I went into Niger to look for a job. There was nothing, though, no jobs and no money. After some time I decided  I had to go to Libya; I was lucky there I suppose, as I was never caught and put in prison, but I think that’s  maybe because I had such a bad time digging the gold. “I found a smuggler and persuaded him to take what little money I had and let me on a boat. The boat headed to Lampedusa, but it took four days to get there, and the journey was very scary. There was no food or water on the boat and the waves were very high; by the fourth day the boat was finished, and the waves were crashing down on it making it sink. Luckily we were near the island by now and could get a network signal. A boat came to rescue us and took us to shore. “I tried to get a train to Rome with my friend but we couldn’t afford tickets and we kept getting caught. But then an Italian lady helped us – she bought us tickets to Rome and took us to her house to sleep and to eat. You find kindness when you least expect it. “From Rome we went to Ventimiglia, but again I had no money for a smuggler. There were lots of guys living under a bridge there and a charity that gave us food and water. Some of these guys were getting a car to France with a smuggler. It was only $40 to pay but I didn’t even have that, but I managed to get in unnoticed. I wasn’t found and got to France. “From the border I travelled to Marseille and then Paris. In Paris I had to sleep on the street for two days, I had no phone and no money. Again I found a kind man who lent me his phone so I could call my friends to make a plan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today we had some truly brilliant news. Kamal, a 22-year-old Sudanese refugee whose been in detention for two months under threat of being sent to Rwanda, has finally been freed.</p>

Again I found a kind man who lent me his phone so I could call my friends to make a plan. We decided to meet in Calais to try to cross to the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I was in Calais for nearly 10 months. It was a very hard time, and I had to rely on charities for everything. I had no money and I tried so many times to get across on the lorries and by boat. One time a French police officer who had caught me lots of times told me, “if I see you again, you will not be alive to try any more.” So I hid for about a month and did not try. Then in June this year I met a group of people who had paid for a boat and when they ran to the sea with it I ran with them, and no one noticed or pushed me out, and I got across.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I was in some place for three days and then taken to a detention centre called Brook House, where I got the letter for Rwanda. It was a horrible time, after everything they were going to send me back to Africa. I could not go back; I love my homeland but it’s not safe. I became very miserable. So it was a great relief when I found out Care4Calais were going to help me.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m in Liverpool – well, Runcorn actually. I like it here and I’ve met some lovely volunteers. But I want to move on. I want to get my education now and become a teacher. Education makes the difference in how people are treated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“To others going through a journey like mine I would say don’t give up. Just keep fighting, cross all the barriers you find, take a chance and do it with a brave and proud heart. I am glad I am here – but I don’t feel safe yet.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can help Kamal and others like him by writing to your local newspaper to raise awareness. We provide a template letter and can help you to send it.  Read how here =&gt; <a href="https://bit.ly/RWDwrite?fbclid=IwAR1lanr5ZC5MsvUEPSJEjW1SAbTibRjR1m7zAxefT4dQiBDC8erCK3Td-8Q">bit.ly/RWDwrite</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; When I was a child in Iraq I had a speech impediment, and was constantly bullied and made fun of. My family thought I’d grow out of it, but I didn’t, and as I got older it got harder to learn and make friends. People would shout names at me on the street, and punch and kick me just because I was different. No one tried to stop it. I couldn’t help the problem as I was born with it. It came with a learning difficulty that affects my memory. I forget so many things. The bullying was hard for me to take and my mental health suffered. By the time I was in my twenties my father had become afraid someone would kill me, and he told me to hide in the house, and never go out. I did what he said. My name is Shalaw, and I am Kurdish. Living in Iraq was hard for me, and staying inside was not a life, so at 23 my father and I decided I must leave the country. My father found a smuggler who got me onto a plane to Istanbul where they put me in another smuggler’s house. It was terrible. They took my passport and would not let me out. They said I had to stay hidden. Finally one day they put me in a lorry, which didn’t stop until I reached Calais where I had to get out. From Calais it was up to me to get across the English Channel. It took many tries but finally I made it. The authorities sent me to Crewe to the house where I’m living now. I got a lawyer and found some good people who really help me. Volunteers from Care4Calais have helped me a lot. When the card I use to get my £39 a week government allowance stopped working for a while, a Care4Calais volunteer called Pauline bought me food. The card is working now. I like it here because no one makes fun of me. For the first time ever in my life, people treat me with respect. It is not like Iraq, there are no equality laws or harassment laws. My lawyer has been good to me, but so far the Home Office will not believe how much I struggle with my speech and my memory, or how much torment I suffered in Iraq. They don’t listen when you talk about bullying. They say my story has changed, but that’s the whole problem, I am here because my memory makes things difficult for me. I told them how hard my life was in Iraq but my first asylum claim was denied. I felt very sad and didn’t know what to do, but I have been allowed to appeal to a tribunal, and today I sent in my papers for that. My housemate Shaun, Pauline, and another Care4Calais volunteer called Shelagh have helped me a lot with everything, and I hope the Home Office will listen and let me make a future here. For now, though, I must wait and hope. To volunteer or donate go to Care4Calais.org</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>When you’ve walked from Khartoum to Calais, through Iran and Turkey and most of Europe, Stockton seems a very small place. I’ve been here three months now. It’s OK. I have my own house now, I share it with four friends from Africa, Afghan and Iran. It is better then the hotel in some ways as I have my own space, but in the hotel I had lots of Syrian friends and we would sit and talk so much about everything and nothing at all! I do miss that. I left Syria when I was 19 and I am now 29. It has taken me 10 years to get here. I am very scared about my interview. The residency issue always confuses my mind and the thoughts that I may be deported are never far away. I’ve already been deported once, from Lebanon, I don’t want it to happen again. I can’t go through that again. I like to read. It takes my mind off all my problems and I can escape. I have only been learning English for 6 months, so it is still difficult, especially as there are no Arabic books in Stockton library. They said they cannot get me any either, so I am trying my best to learn English very fast! I do read on my phone but I have problems with my eyes, so I really like books better. One of my favourite authors is Agatha Christie. I know her books are old, but her mind is so big and she is so clever. I never know who did it! I remember my mum reading stories to me a long time ago in Syria. That is a nice memory. I liked to write stories too, I still do. I have written about my journey to France. I hope to get it translated one day and then you can read it too. When my residency issue is sorted out, I want to study media, I would like to be a political journalist and continue writing and finding out about the world. I have many friends from Care4Calais, it is the best organisation in the world! They supported me when I needed them and now I want to give something back and volunteer with them in Stockton. &#8211; Mohammed To support our work go to Care4Calais.org/donate</p>

<p>One of my favourite authors is Agatha Christie. I know her books are old, but her mind is so big and she is so clever. I never know who did it!</p>
<p>I remember my mum reading stories to me a long time ago in Syria. That is a nice memory. I liked to write stories too, I still do. I have written about my journey to France. I hope to get it translated one day and then you can read it too.</p>
<p>When my residency issue is sorted out, I want to study media, I would like to be a political journalist and continue writing and finding out about the world.</p>
<p>I have many friends from Care4Calais, it is the best organisation in the world! They supported me when I needed them and now I want to give something back and volunteer with them in Stockton.</p>
