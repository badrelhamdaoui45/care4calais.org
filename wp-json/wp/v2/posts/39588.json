He was now reassured, and so much calmer. Within a day or two he had had a proper age assessment, and been confirmed to be under 18.

In fact, Amez found it difficult with the family at first. He wasn&#8217;t sure how to act, or what to say. The family were kind, but there were no other young people around.
