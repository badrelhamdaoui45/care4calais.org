I didn\u2019t know what to do, I couldn\u2019t eat, I couldn\u2019t sleep, I couldn\u2019t even kill myself, even though I wanted to. I would have asked my father, but we had lost him when I was young, so I didn\u2019t even have that.<br \/>\nI stayed in the village for two weeks, but then I had to run away. As I went I took every risk there was, I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to be killed.<br \/>\nI travelled through the desert and eventually found myself in Libya.<br \/>\nI had no education and no money, I couldn\u2019t read or write. But I worked for a Libyan man for a year, working day and night, doing anything in any weather. I dreamed of getting away and traveling on the \u201cdeath boats\u201d people use to try to get across the Mediterranean from Libya. I thought that perhaps one of the waves I would meet my death and be buried in the sea bed.<br \/>\nBut death refused to take me, and I made it to England.
