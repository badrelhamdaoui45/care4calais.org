So I applied to annie@care4calais.org, did my DBS and some training and got started.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Early on me and my brother were dropping some stuff off to a hotel when I saw a bunch of young men milling about outside. It was winter but they had no coats and were wearing flips flops. i wondered if they were refugees and if they needed anything. I was so nervous, but i plucked up my courage and went over to them. It was so easy after that, they were all so nice to me and asked me for a few things, so i made a list and said we\u2019d be back.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">We started collecting stuff and it\u2019s amazing the number of things we were given, my mum gets upset with all the bags and boxes in her house, so at least that makes us give most stuff out quickly. We\u2019ve been able to give out 50 date boxes for Ramadan, help at the hotels and in dispersal accommodation.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I love to see the progress people make, from when they first arrive to when they feel safe and understand how to get around and access services in the UK. This is why Care4Calais is so important, it is the only charity that meets the refugees face to face regularly for social events, sports, chats, games and a cup of tea. This is so important for mental health. Some of the young men are stuck in a hostel for over a year not being able to do anything. Care4Calais changes that and gives them something to look forward to.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">The other great thing about Care4Calais and why it is so loved by the refugees is that it is a massive network throughout the UK. No matter where I get a request from or a place a refugee is sent to, I can find a group or person in the area to help them and to get them what they need. The network is like a spider\u2019s web reaching every corner of the UK, it is a brilliant living thing, it\u2019s geographical mobility! This got me a nickname the other day when I got something for a refugee many miles from me, I got a text back saying, \u201cThank You Mother of Distribution\u201d. I think it was a google translate error, but it made me smile.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">At first it was emotionally very hard, so many people wanted things that I didn\u2019t have and i would try to get them straight away which was just impossible. But now i have set myself boundaries and I am very clear with the refugees about what I can and cannot do. There is a group of us, and we can support each other and ask for help when we need it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Today I am going my group at a new hotel where 130 people have been sent. We are doing a bit of an emergency distribution. I know we will be very short on decent shoes.
