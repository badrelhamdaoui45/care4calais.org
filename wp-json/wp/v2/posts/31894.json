I read the book while Simon was mending a bike, and when he had finished he stayed to chat with me. I will remember that long after I forget the book.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Akain is from north Darfur in Sudan, but he left his home more than ten years ago now, after a Janjaweed militia group raided his village. In the raid, the Janjaweed killed many people. One of them was Akrain\u2019s wife.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He fled to a displaced persons camp, and stayed there for ten years. He met English people in the camp who helped him to learn the English language. He had always wanted to learn it, he says, and shown this kindness, he worked hard at it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He also worked as a barber. Years later, here in Calais, he now uses that skill to cut the hair of the refugees here when Care4Calais volunteers bring the hairdressing equipment with them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Displacement camps are hard places to live, and they are not meant to be forever. Feeling he was going nowhere in the camp, and always short of money and food, Akain finally decided that if he wanted a new life he would have to leave.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cI escaped to Egypt in an old Toyota, and then crossed the border into Turkey. It cost money to bribe the guards, but I used my brother\u2019s passport \u2013 he looks like me \u2013 to get across. From Egypt I crossed the sea to some Greek islands, where I ended up in some camps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cThere is nothing in those camps, no school, no anything, and no way out. They moved me a few times, and then the camp I was in caught on fire. The police told me there was nowhere else for me and I had to go, so I was finally free to move. I went to Athens, then up into Italy by train, and then to France.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cSo now I am just waiting to cross the English Channel. It\u2019s really difficult.

So ,we just wait here and try to plan how we will get to the UK.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the long, slow days here in Northern France, he finds himself thinking back to his childhood in Darfur. He grew up in a small village, and spent his childhood looking after goats, sheep, camels and horses. He didn\u2019t get to go to school much, but when he did he always tried to learn some English when he did. He remembers it as a happy time, bittersweet to recall.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cI\u2019m older than a lot of refugees, nearly 37 now, so I remember a time before the war there.
