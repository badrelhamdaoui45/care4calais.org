The person who&#8217;s pulled me out of deep, dark holes and who&#8217;s challenged me to countless debates. The friend who always needs a new book, who taught me how to make chicken stew and who cracks me open a beer as I scoff at the news. Perhaps more profoundly, I was the one he wanted there when he got his refugee result, when he got his University scholarship and when he acted as an interpreter for the first time. And similarly, he was the first person I called when I received acknowledgements from both the Royal family and the Red Cross for &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; humanitarian service &#8211; and he has been such an inspiration to both, he&#8217;s the reason I published a book.<\/p>\n<p>When I asked Salah to describe in his own words, what it means to just be &#8216;Salah&#8217; to me, not &#8216;Salah the refugee&#8217; he replied, &#8220;this means a lot,&#8221; and paused. &#8220;This is very deep.

You don&#8217;t know what that means for me. Yes, it&#8217;s true we grew up in different environments, but that is one of the richest things of our friendship. Diversity means richness. In the natural environment, we see diversity in forests. It means richness. Now I live in France, with different people, different culture, different religion and different attitudes.
