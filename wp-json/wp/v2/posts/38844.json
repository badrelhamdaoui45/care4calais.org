I went in and she cried when she saw me. Her partner was there and you said &#8216;when you arrived, it was the first time her heart her blood pressure has gone down.&#8217; Wow.

They said &#8216;You know, we are treated worse than animals here, because they take away our tents, our shelter. We sleep on the floor, with the snakes.&#8217; I never forgot that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020 we asked Seema if she could help an asylum seeker at a hotel in her area, and she agreed. Realising that there were other refugees in the hotel, but not allowed in to meet them, she began going down with fresh fruit at the same time each week, and waiting outside. Word got around, and soon she was able to ask people what else they needed, and begin sourcing it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She still brings that same resourcefulness and determination to everything she does for refugees, and is a wonderful leader.
