People often have to choose between a shower, a hot meal or charging. It also means they feel they lose a day as they can\u2019t try to cross if they haven\u2019t charged their phone. They wait so patiently and although they are disappointed when we leave there is never any trouble and the people collect their phones and wander off back to their bit of scrubland in the hope their tent is still there.<\/p>\n<p>Many refugees lose their phones in evictions, and replacements are expensive to buy, but we try to provide as many as we can.
