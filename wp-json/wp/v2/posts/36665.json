We were always moving around.<\/p>\n<p>We left Djibouti and went to Ethiopia so my mum could find work, but when I was nine she passed away, and I was left alone. Some people we knew took me in, but I had to work to feed myself.

I had managed to save some money, and some people I knew helped me with the rest. With the passport I got a plane ticket to Paris. I was so scared on the plane, and I was sure they would find me out. But it was my only chance, so I was willing to risk everything.<\/p>\n<p>In Paris I did not know how anything worked, so I followed a small group of people from Eritrea out of the airport. I followed them all the way, step by step to Calais!<\/p>\n<p>In Calais I couldn\u2019t afford a boat across the Channel, so I stayed in the jungle and met some other people. They had bought a boat themselves. The day they tried to get to the UK, I helped them get the boat, and carry it to the beach. run with it down the beach.
