Three more men had their deportations stopped by an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). This meant there was no deportation to Rwanda yesterday. The ECHR gave four main reasons for its decision: &#8211; The Evidence from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees that asylum seekers in Rwanda would not have access to a fair and efficient process to determine their asylum claim. &#8211; That the UK courts had acknowledged that this evidence raised very serious issues, even though they decided not the stop the removal. &#8211; That enforcing human rights in Rwanda would be difficult as Rwanda is not part of the European Convention on Human Rights. &#8211; That there is no legally-enforceable way of ensuring someone would be returned to the UK if the policy was found unlawful. Because of this, the ECHR was satisfied that there was a real and imminent risk of severe and irreversible harm, and so it ordered that the individuals should not be removed from the UK. This was a great relief for us, for the individuals concerned and for their families. However, it is by no means over yet. The important hearing is the one in July. In July we will go to court again for the court to decide whether the Rwanda policy itself is lawful. This will be an incredibly important decision for many refugees, and for the future of the UK.
