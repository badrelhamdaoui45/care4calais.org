I drive one of the two speedboats.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">We\u2019d not long got back to the ship from rescuing boat three. Phil, head of mission told us that there\u2019d been a mayday call. A plane had spotted a rubber boat which was sinking, with over fifty people in the water. It was over ten miles away. The briefing was short. What equipment to take, the location for the chart plotter, good luck, go. It was that kind of thing. Just get there. Do what you\u2019ve trained so hard for. Go!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Ten miles on the speedboat takes a while. I swear that it just doesn\u2019t go any faster than I took it. 37kn pretty much all the way, scanning the horizon. Looking. All the while knowing that people were drowning. I knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to save them all, and we didn\u2019t. God damn this is hard to write.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">After a while we could see small dots which got bigger. Boats first, then people. We could see the Libyan Coast Guard had got there first. There were still loads of people in the water screaming for rescue, splashing desperately, most unable to swim, some with little rubber inner tubes round them, still kicking hard to keep their heads above water, the fucking panicked manic desperate final efforts to survive. They\u2019d been in the water for so long already. These were their final moments.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">We followed our training, just about as quickly as it would be possible to do it. I slowed down a little for a safe approach, hearing the distress call on our arrival. We got the first two people struggling over the same tyre tube, then we started hauling them in. Another to our side swimming towards us, just so frantic as he got to the boat, then reach over and pull him in too.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">The first ones in the boat lay on the floor exhausted, still screaming, we repositioned. In front of us, there were loads of people. I heard a female voice shouting \u201cseawatch three please save us\u201d. They even knew who we were. What the fuck? One guy on the boat got his breath back a little. He was shaking violently with hypothermia. Through trembling lips he kept saying \u201cNo Libya, No Libya\u201d. He was so scared to be taken back he just kept saying it over and over.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I can\u2019t piece it all together, but before long we had six or seven in our boat. They were in shit state. Hypothermic, with foam running from their mouths and noses. Some of them started to help pull in more people. It really wasn\u2019t the prettiest rescue, just haul them in, sit them down, no time for first aid or rescue blankets, just reposition and get the next one, and the next one and the next one.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">The Libyans were on scene and had deployed their small RHIB. Some of the people jumped from the Libyans RHIB to swim towards us. I saw a woman (22 years old) on the Libyan Coast Guard ship as she fought off the guard and then jumped in the water. She swam toward us. I found out later that she didn\u2019t know how to swim but chose this over being returned to Libya. They were all just so terrified.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">We looked under the deflated wreck of the boat that had sunk, as we couldn\u2019t see any more people trying to swim, we started to search for any signs of life, all with the chattering of teeth all around us, the coughing, the sobbing, the praying. With incredibly traumatised people on our boat we just continued to search.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">It was very strange and I\u2019ve never seen it before (apparently it has happened before), but the Libyan Coast Guard then transferred the people to us. First from their little RHIB and then eventually from their big boat. We did a scan around and could see nobody. Then, I guess the person might have been obscured by the Libyans, one of the people on the other speedboat spotted something. Some splashing and then a hand reaching out of the water. Both speedboats went as fast as possible, but it was too late. One of the guys on the boat I was driving, saw something sinking under the water, but it was impossible to get there. The person drowned right in front of us, froth and bubbles rose to the surface. Gone.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">One boy told me he\u2019d lost his brother. We searched the whole area. There was nobody else to save. I asked one guy how many people were on the boat that had left Libya. He said 55. We did a head count. 38. So, 17 people had drowned. Most had drowned before we got there, some right under our noses. Right at that moment though, the 38 people were our priority. Some were near death from severe hypothermia, having been in the water for half an hour or more. They were sat and laid shivering on our boat. Some couldn\u2019t even sit up, some drifting in and out of consciousness, some shaking violently, some not at all. Some had clothes all on, some had kicked their clothes off in their desperate struggle to survive. It was completely fucked up. We put rescue blankets on them and took them back to the ship.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Two of the women were heavily pregnant. One guy was just in and out. We\u2019d rescued them from the sea but that was just the start. Getting them up and onto our ship was difficult. And then the deck team took them. They were showered with fresh water as some of them had terrible burns caused by the fuel from their boat mixed with salt water. Then the hospital cases. The medical team worked for days with hardly any sleep. God knows how they did it. All of the crew mucked in, each of us taking our turn to cook, clean and help in all kinds of ways.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I can\u2019t really weigh up exactly what happened over the next days with the people, but there were ten medevacs. Some of them had developed signs of secondary drowning. They were all extremely exhausted but more than that, their bodies ached for days from the excursion. The mental trauma. Everything!Eventually we got them to Sicily and the rest of the people were disembarked. Now they\u2019ll be in quarantine and then they\u2019ll go through the asylum process.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Later we learned that among the dead was a 16 year old boy, that some of the dead were relatives of some of the survivors. They all have names, loved ones. I just can\u2019t describe how precious each of them was. Fuck Europe for allowing this to happen.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">That night I was chatting to one of the survivors, a 17 year old Liberian boy. He and his brother, Samuel who was 19 had left home three years earlier. Samuel was one of those who had drowned. I told him I was sorry. That we tried. I\u2019m sorry. Then he asked me \u201cHow do I tell my mother that my brother is dead?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know my friend, but when it\u2019s time you will find the words\u201d<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I want to live in a better world than this. Nobody deserves to drown at sea. What is wrong with us for allowing this to happen? We need a change. Tens of thousands of people have drowned in this sea in recent years. It is no accident. It is a policy decision. Our governments have withdrawn all of their rescue ships. They\u2019re allowing human beings to drown in our moat in order to create a deterrent. A deterrent of death by drowning. And for as long as we accept our governments position on this, and for as long as we allow our media to dehumanise and rationalise, and for as long as we let our friends speak of this as being acceptable, then boys like Samuel will drown over and over again. And last thing. I\u2019ve said it before and I will say it over and over again: we would not allow this to happen if the people drowning were white.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">&#8211; Brendon Woodhouse<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Photo credit: Mich\u00e9l Kekul\u00e9<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been on a search and rescue mission for the last few weeks with Sea-Watch, in the central Mediterranean Sea, just north or Libya.
