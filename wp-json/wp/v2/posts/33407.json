People smugglers had brought him there, but he didn\u2019t know where he was, and asked the Border Control guards who had detained him if he could walk into London to buy some food, as he was hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI guess it broke the ice, as they all laughed.

It was so beautifully friendly, and although I was homeless there were lots of places that helped me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I arrived I had no English, so I set about learning it. I watched The Vampire Diaries on TV, and finding it so much fun to watch I learned a lot of English from it.

And it was there that my story really begins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne night I was just flicking through YouTube and I stumbled across a video of a guy swimming. He looked as if he was flying through the water, with nothing stopping him. I watched more of his videos, and something just got caught hold of me, and I knew what I wanted to do. I was going to be a swimmer; I was going to be the next Michael Phelps and I was going to go to the Olympics! I was 23 at the time. There was just one small problem in that I couldn\u2019t swim, but hey, you\u2019ve got to start somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was a bit odd I chose swimming I suppose, because I nearly died in a boat crossing the Mediterranean. That was a really terrifying experience, and I\u2019ve only swum in the sea once, since then \u2013 I prefer pools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAnyway, I got some swimming trunks and I went to the pool. I couldn\u2019t afford lessons so I hung about in the corners of pools watching the trainers. I\u2019m actually surprised I wasn\u2019t arrested now I think about it! I copied the swimmers and some of the trainers noticed me and I explained what I was doing. Some invited me to join the groups.

It really doesn\u2019t go very far, but I didn\u2019t let it stop me swimming.

I got better. I watched videos, and went to the pool every day and I became fast. The trainer was actually amazed. I started to win races, progressing to bigger and bigger ones. I dream of qualifying to swim in the olympics ones day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have been supported by so many people, and my story has even been mentioned in parliament!
