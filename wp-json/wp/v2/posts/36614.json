But I stayed until I was about 17, then I couldn\u2019t go to college. The Taliban would not let me go. Instead I just got a job with the old Afghan government, working for the police. There was no chance to do anything else. My dad was in the police force, and he got me the the job. That was all I could do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut the police there are not like your police, they fight and they kill people. They don\u2019t care how old you are, they just give you a gun and tell you to do your job.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut when the Taliban came in July my family and me started to get lots of threats. Anyone who worked for the old government get threats, there is no trial, no prison \u2013 you\u2019re just executed when they find you.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey killed my dad like that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I had to leave.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy mum and sisters helped pay a fee, a very big fee, to a people smuggler. They sacrificed a lot. I didn\u2019t choose the UK, the smugglers choose it for me, and they brought me all the way here.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy mum and my three sisters got threats after I left and they\u2019re still getting them now. The Taliban say they must tell them where I am, or they will be tortured. I\u2019m still scared for my family though. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t show my face in the photograph.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the help of a smuggler Ahmed\u2019s journey was so horrific.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFirst I went into Pakistan, and then Iran. The police on that border are horrible and I was beaten many times. We made our way to Turkey by walking &#8211; lots of walking! \u2013 and in cars. Some of the cars were so full I couldn\u2019t move, and we had to stay in them for long hours.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom Turkey I went to Bulgaria and Serbia \u2013 that meant going from it being very hot in Iran to being freezing cold in Serbia. I was always so, so hungry, but we never had proper food to eat, just a few biscuits and water because that\u2019s all we could buy. In the Balkans was the worst, the police are so bad and I was beaten again, just over and over again.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would think back to my home, and would make me so sad. I remembered all the rivers and the high mountains\u2026 Afghanistan is a beautiful country. Just amazing places, and such beautiful empty spaces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The journey took Ahmed four months. After passing through Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland and France, Ahmed got a small boat across the channel, in February, and ended up in his hotel. It\u2019s somewhere in there countryside \u2013 he thinks he is near Birmingham but isn\u2019t sure \u2013 and he still feels nervous about going out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel safe here though. It is a very secure country and everyone is nice to me, I\u2019m glad this is where I was brought. The UK is the only place the Taliban cannot reach me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ahmed is just a young boy who has been forced to leave his home. He seems bewildered and lost. When I ask about Afghanistan, his eyes fill with tears. \u201cWhat I loved the most was going to Kabul,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city, and is a bit safer than the rest of Afghanistan. I felt secure there. There is so much to do in the city and it is so modern and clean. It is a very beautiful place \u2013 and the dried fruits you can buy are delicious!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like so many refugees he wants to go to college and learn English. He\u2019d like to become a doctor; tell him that it will take him a long time to qualify, and he says he would just love the chance to try. So many young refugees are not able to access learning or jobs in their home country so the chance to learn here is precious.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, he wants to go to the city that he thinks is Birmingham, to see if it is as nice as Kabul. He wants to go to the gym, and to play cricket just like any young man.<\/p>\n<p>Ahmed is still yearning for home \u2013 he loves Afghanistan and everything there, and needs help to really thrive as he could do here.
