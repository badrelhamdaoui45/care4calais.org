Well, we organise weekend convoy trips to Calais for people who may not otherwise go, or those who feel it may all be a bit to daunting to organize and go alone. We do everything from ferry bookings and car sharing to hotel reservations, volunteer placement and even meals out at the infamous Family Pub. We do it all with the least fuss possible, we\u2019re very low on agro and chat and high on action.

They have to be open minded, self reliant and willing to work. We don\u2019t take tourists! The formula works, we have so many repeat volunteers. The trips are transformative and reshape other areas of our volunteers lives to- invigorate them to do something more, whether it is for refugees or not, but just to do and be more.<\/p>\n<p>We chose Care4Calais as one of our main beneficiaries as they do something special, something really important, and hopefully after Covid we will do so again. They make sure that anyone who wants to, gets to meet the refugees, spend time with them play cricket or drink a cup of tea after distribution. No other charity does this with short term volunteers, but it\u2019s this aspect that changes hearts and minds and makes people want to return.<\/p>\n<p>Care4Calais have always made us very welcome and organised our days effectively. They give our volunteers a chance to talk to staff and refugees in the evening and to ask any questions they may have over a glass of wine or cup of tea.
