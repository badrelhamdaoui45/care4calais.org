It\u2019s a stark reminder of why the refugees are there. I was at the hairdressing station with some guys chatting and having a laugh over a cup of tea, when they started joking about how hard it was to get on the lorries, and how they\u2019d be trying to get on one that night.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Then one young guy, Ahmed, just said, \u201cYeah, you know last week my friend was trying to get on a lorry.

It shocked me to think that any of the guys could be killed that night.

The refugees were so sociable and friendly, and I was chatting with a guy called Khalid about DJ Khalid when he casually mentioned spending four days in a boat on the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cThe engine stopped,\u201d he said. \u201c I didn\u2019t think I would make it.\u201d<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">This is normal conversation in Calais.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I remember that even though everyone was so friendly, there was a police van sitting there watching. A threat looking over us. Huge men clad in black riot gear watching a camp of young, unarmed Eritreans who were doing no one any harm at all. In fact there were breast feeding mothers in the camp just looking after their children the best they could.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">There were also moments when I was moved by the positivity and strength.

After the hair, nails and beards were trimmed and cleaned. The service is so appreciated.

Everything was beautifully put together, everything runs smoothly. It was great working with the other volunteers, so many nationalities and people from all walks of life. But everyone had a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude, and a sense of humour so we worked so well as a team. It was also great to see the charity in touch with everyone else there in Calais and working together to make life better for the refugees.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I was knackered when I got back to Cornwall, where I live. It\u2019s really hard work but very refreshing. Soon after I got back I went to see a play with my mum. It wasn\u2019t an especially sad play but I found myself crying through the play. I think that was some of the emotion I\u2019d suppressed while I was in Calais, finding a way out.
