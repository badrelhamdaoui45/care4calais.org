It worries me that some may fall through the gaps and I want to help where I can to make sure that does not happen.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still a desperate need for volunteers in the Manchester warehouse, and there is always something to do, whether it is moving boxes or pairing shoes. The warehouse has now moved to Smithfield Market, which is great for me as I only live a mile up the road. The camaraderie of the volunteers and their passion to help is infectious and you really feel you\u2019ve made a difference by the time you leave.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really easy to volunteer for Care4Calais, red tape is minimal with no compromise to safety. If you want to help &#8211; just rock up at the warehouse for a few hours.
