My father died when I was young, and my mum took me back to Chad where she was from. I grew up in Chad, but really it was no better than Sudan. The Janjaweed are also there, and is so dangerous for small people from villages. The Janjaweed burn and destroy the villages, and take the young men by force.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I did not want to join them because I don\u2019t want to kill my people for no reason.

In Africa family is everything and we stay close all our lives. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered where my family was, I would travel to join them.

But if the police find it they kick the flour into the dirt and pour the oil on the ground so we cannot use them. It is very hard to get flour and oil as we have no money to buy it ourselves, so it is really upsetting when this happens.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Some of the police are really bad.

He was just trying to cross \u2013 he didn\u2019t need to die that way. He didn\u2019t want to harm anyone, just have a chance of a life, like everyone wants. All we need is a safe way to pass.
