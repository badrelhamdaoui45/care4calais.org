When I first arrived in Calais I had no intention of setting up a charity; I could not have imagined one which now supports thousands of people seeking asylum in the UK as well as refugees in northern France. Over the last few years I have been proud to volunteer alongside so many fantastic people who support some of the most vulnerable in our society. I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. I also want to thank everyone who has donated, whether money or coats or equipment, without you we couldn&#8217;t have provided refugees with much needed support. I am now leaving Care4Calais to focus on campaigning for safe routes for refugees and I will be working alongside our incredible trade union partners to ensure safe passage becomes a reality. My heartfelt thanks go to every person who stands up and fights at this dark time for refugee rights in the UK.
