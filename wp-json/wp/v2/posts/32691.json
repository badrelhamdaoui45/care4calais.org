I\u2019m a British citizen now, but I\u2019m from Cyprus originally, and I\u2019d been watching the situation with refugees in Greece for years before.

Being busy volunteering has kept me sane during the pandemic!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many refugees in London \u2013 one of our hotels has 300 in it alone, so you can imagine the degree of need that there is.

Still, with a bit of hard work we managed to find storage space for the donations, and then a small place where we could invite people to come to get things. For that first distribution, I got in contact with the hotel and invited refugees to come. Then we volunteers went to meet them, and lead them to the venue. We knew they were in a strange city, and we wanted to be sure they could find it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like the Pied Piper walking around London with everyone following me. It was quite funny really; everyone was looking the wrong way for the traffic and in totally the wrong clothes for London in October.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With distributions, you learn what works best from experience, and we\u2019ve found that things feel better with smaller groups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second one, we invited 30 people from one of the hotels.

As our time window is limited, we have to be strict about the amount of time we allow each person to look for things. I\u2019m very bad at this, far too soft, but luckily other team members are much tougher than me, and keep things rolling. And if people don\u2019t find exactly what they want, they know we\u2019ll be back again and there\u2019ll be another chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next week we\u2019re going to a third hotel. It\u2019s the biggest one to have Afghans staying, with over 300 people there. Having\u00a0 visited already, I\u2019ve seen there are a lot of children. In fact the high number of children is one of the things that\u2019s special about this group of refugees \u2013 clothes and equipment for kids are in high demand. The hotel management have said they need 60 buggies, but at the time of writing\u00a0 we have six left, so we\u2019ll be finding more!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the Afghan people were so bewildered when they first arrived in the UK.

For some, the UK seems very alien \u2013 we do things very differently, and there is so much to learn and do in order to make a life here. The Afghans tend to like different things to the young refugees we\u2019ve become used to. They like smart shoes and shirts, not the usual trainers and skinny jeans.
