I came from a corporate background, and knew nothing of humanitarian work, politics or world affairs. I went to Calais because I had vaguely heard about the problems there, but you don&#8217;t believe it till you see it. The people I met there changed my understanding of the world. I didn\u2019t help them because they had fled terrible wars, or suffered awful persecution. No; I got stuck in because there were hungry, cold people in front of me who needed help, and it felt normal and human to reach out to them. That normal, human kindness and decency is what\u2019s really missing from the Nationality and Borders Bill. Now we\u2019ve read it, we know it\u2019s true aim \u2013 essentially, the removal of rights of many of the refugees who come to the UK. No wonder people are calling it \u201cthe anti-refugee bill\u201d. Don\u2019t forget: this bill, if passed, would make it a criminal offence to enter the UK without an official permit. Judges will be able to sentence refugees who do so for up to four years. It would allow the government to send asylum seekers to other countries to have their claims processed &#8211; a move that would hugely damage already-traumatised people. And it would almost certainly contravene the 1951 Refugee Convention. It is quite simply denial of common human decency. Those of us who work with refugees know the vast majority have no choice but to travel illegally. Dictators don\u2019t issue visas. People lose passports in wars and conflicts. Being forced to travel \u201cwithout permission\u201d is simply part of being a refugee.

If a fireman goes to a house to put out a fire, do they stop outside and ask who is in the house or whether they are worth saving? Of course not. So why with refugees must they be deserving of our help? To think they are not deserving flies in the face of all evidence. When you get to know people in Calais, and hear about the horrors they have suffered, you understand why they are willing to take such terrible risks as crossing the Channel in small, flimsy boats. I\u2019m haunted by the stories i\u2019ve heard. From the hundreds of people who have been sold as slaves, tortured or raped in Libya. From people who, the same country, were electrocuted while their families heard them scream down the phone. From the Syrian refugees, lovely people who explain how every single family has been hit by the conflict in the country, and how they had to leave their homes and families ot save their lives.
