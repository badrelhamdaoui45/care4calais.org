Would you break the law? Put yourself in danger? Risk your life? We asked more than 2,000 people how far they\u2019d go for their loved ones, and an overwhelming majority said they\u2019d do ANYTHING for their loved ones. Now we want to get people thinking &#8211; if as Brits we think we\u2019d do anything for our friends and families, then maybe it\u2019s time to start welcoming the brave refugees who have already taken such risks. Because when refugees travel thousands of miles to find safety for themselves and their loved ones, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing. We want to share the feelings of people like those in this video to change how Britain sees refugees, and challenge the government\u2019s cruel anti-refugee policies. As the Government prepares to debate its cruel Illegal Immigration Bill, we&#8217;re launching Anything For Love \u2013 a campaign designed to help people see that refugees are just people like them. Like all of us. Please get involved and spread the word by sharing this video, and more of of the findings that we&#8217;ll be sharing in the next few weeks. &nbsp;"}
