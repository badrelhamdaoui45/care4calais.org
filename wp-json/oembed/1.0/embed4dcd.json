Both ways, you could be killed. I don\u2019t want to take either, because I am so afraid of losing my life. But my family spent all their money to get me to safety. So what I can do? I must go on.\u201d This is how Osama from Sudan described his life in Calais to me. I was sitting at Osama\u2019s campfire after distribution one evening with some of his friends. They\u2019d built the fire where they were living, in some scrub land in the hope the police wouldn\u2019t come and destroy their tents. He told me was the eldest of seven children. With the conflict in Sudan meaning they had no hope of escaping danger and poverty, the family had given him all the money they had to help him get to northern France. Even so, he had arrived here with only the clothes on his back, and is now getting by on the help that organisations like Care4Calais provide. \u201cYou know, phone charging is the most important thing you do for us,\u201d he said. Phones are vital to refugees. They\u2019re the only way to stay in contact with home, and to check the weather, which is really important if they\u2019re crossing by boat. They also need the GPS to make sure they\u2019re going in the right direction, and then they may need to call the coast guard to be rescued. Sometimes they have to walk a few hours to go to a phone charging point and then wait for their turn to charge the phone. At distributions, Care4Calais provides charging points \u2013 rows of sockets fixed to a board which is then plugged into a generator. Although the boards can charge dozens of phones at a time, there are always more people than sockets, and the generators only operate for a few hours a day. Sometimes it can take a whole day just to get a phone charged. People often have to choose between a shower, a hot meal or charging. It also means they feel they lose a day as they can\u2019t try to cross if they haven\u2019t charged their phone. They wait so patiently and although they are disappointed when we leave there is never any trouble and the people collect their phones and wander off back to their bit of scrubland in the hope their tent is still there. Many refugees lose their phones in evictions, and replacements are expensive to buy, but we try to provide as many as we can. We mainly rely on people in the UK donating their old phones to us, so if you have one please send it to us \u2013 we\u2019ll make sure it finds a good home, and you\u2019ll make a refugee very happy. I hoped Osama\u2019s phone got him to the UK all right. \u201cI cannot be silly with this life,\u201d he said as we ended our conversation. \u201cI know either way to the UK is very dangerous, but what can I do? My family is praying for me.\u201d"}
