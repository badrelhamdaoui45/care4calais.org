She seems quite well-to-do and let&#x2019;s just say I thought she might not be well-disposed to refugees. For that reason, when my 12-year-old daughter Eva said she&#x2019;d like to ask our neighbours if they had any coats they&#x2019;d donate to Care4Calais, I said of course, but just be careful with Alice. If she says no, maybe don&#x2019;t push the point. Eva is quite passionate on the subject, and I didn&#x2019;t her, or indeed Alice, to get hurt. About an hour after setting out, Eva came back with a big armful of coats. &#x201C;Where they are from?&#x201D; I asked &#x201C;All from Alice,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Did you know her mum and dad were refugees?&#x201D; It turns out my supposedly stand-offish neighbour&#x2019;s parents came over from Austria in the 1930s. Her father worked as a doctor here, her mother as a teacher. Alice, retired now, spent her working life as a translator. She was delighted to help, and donated some coats that had belonged to her late husband. So like I said, between them, an outspoken, open-hearted kid and an older lady have taught me something: Don&#x2019;t ever underestimate the role that refugees have played in this country&#x2019;s history, or assume that we know what other people&#x2019;s feelings are. Making us mistrust each other is all part of how this rotten government&#x2019;s propaganda works. Don&#x2019;t fall for it like I did.
