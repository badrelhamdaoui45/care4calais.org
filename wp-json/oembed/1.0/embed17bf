Yes, joy! &#x201C;Because you see joy on the faces of people when you make them feel safe and wanted, and you feel joy at being part of a team doing good things. That&#x2019;s why our Care4Calais team celebrates when things go right, and if people are hostile to us and refugees, well, when they go low, we go high. &#x201C;If the far right are doing hateful things in our area, we say RIGHT! Let&#x2019;s have some picnics! Let&#x2019;s throw a party! Let&#x2019;s do things that are filled with love! &#x201C;You can take activism and make it fun. That&#x2019;s why you can see me in the picture taking the Stop Rwanda message to Hogwarts!&#x201D; Katie Spencer Matthews, our regional lead for West Yorkshire is an irrepressible force of nature. Laughing, chatting and joking all the way, she somehow manages to run a team supporting more than 1000 refugees, as well as teaching drama and sharing a home with partner and a daughter. She got involved during the Pandemic, first as a virtual volunteer. &#x201C;The first lady I helped was a survivor of female genital mutilation. She had fled her home because she had given birth to a little girl, and there was there was no way she was ever going to let anybody do that to her child. &#x201C;As I helped her and her daughter with clothing, and put them in touch with local services, I realised there must be many more people with stories like that, and it was important to keep going, helping them. And after that I never stopped!&#x201D; Katie feels lucky because all the West Yorkshire team gelled quickly, and get on well. Volunteering doesn&#x2019;t feel like work, because they&#x2019;re friends. &#x201C;I mean, it&#x2019;s no real hardship to walk into an asylum accommodation with a fantastic bunch of people and help lots of refugees, is it?&#x201D; She&#x2019;s helped hundreds of people. One particular big win she remembers was a 16 year old Yemeni boy, who we&#x2019;ll call A. Katie asked his school to keep him back a year so he would catch up properly, and when the head agreed on condition she found A a tutor, she persuaded a tutor friend called Emily to do it free. She ended up being employed by the school to help other refugees, and grew close to the boy and his parents. &#x201C;They have leave to remain now,&#x201D; Katie says, &#x201C;the school has a great teacher, and they are basically part of Emily&#x2019;s family now. If that&#x2019;s not a case for joy, what is?&#x201D; She laughs. You can tell Katie&#x2019;s relationships with refugees is amazing &#x2013; they smile when she walks into a room, and some of them take the mickey out of her Yorkshire accent, repeating what she has said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s terrible!&#x201D; She says, &#x201C;The Yorkshire accent gets the mickey taken out of it all over the country, and now it even gets laughed at by refugees!&#x201D; There are a few downsides, she says. It&#x2019;s horrible when asylum seekers are waiting for their interviews and you can&#x2019;t speed it up for them. And when they get moved on quickly, so you don&#x2019;t get to say goodbye. She reckons the key to spreading understanding is telling stories. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the most efficient way of gaining support. For a lot of people , a refugee is a statistic; an unknown concept, someone they never met and have no terms of reference for. Just sharing someone&#x2019;s individual story can change all that.&#x201D; To donate to Care4Calais work in West Yorkshire go to: peoplesfundraising.com/fundraising/west-yorkshire-care4calais</description></oembed>
