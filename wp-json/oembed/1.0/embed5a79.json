I was sorting shoes and trainers that have been donated to refugees when I came across this little handwritten note stuck in a pair of boys school shoes. \u201cMy name is Mark,\u201d it read. \u201cAnd I really do hope that these shoes go a long way to changing your life.\u201d Just a few words, but a moment of thoughtfulness that says a lot about the compassion of the young man who had sent them. Refugees have often had to leave their homeland with nothing but the clothes on their back, and because they are forced to walk long distances their shoes often wear out. So to get a new pair can make a really huge difference to someone. They\u2019re not just more comfortable and dry, they all bring a bit of dignity too. I could imagine them bringing a smile back to the face of someone, and when they saw that note, they would know that someone in their new home country cared. As a volunteer with CareCalais I\u2019m constantly touched by how generous people are, and to see this kindness really moved me and gave me hope. We are hugely thankful for Sal&#8217;s Shoes, the charity that helped these shoes and many more besides reach us. They specialise in \u201cfinding new feet for preloved children\u2019s shoes\u201d, to use their lovely description, and they do amazing work helping us with footwear for the young refugees we help. We\u2019d like to express our gratitude to everyone at Sal\u2019s here. And, of course, we\u2019d like to add a special thank you to you, Mark.
