I left because of the war \u2013 there was no education and the pressure to fight with one side or another was too great. I didn\u2019t know who I was fighting or why . I was only a child. \u201cMy family said I should leave if I did not want to die. There was also no way for me to get money to feed myself, so really I did not have a choice. \u201cThe Iraqi government does not give refugees any support, money or food. We always have to borrow money to buy things to eat, and my wife\u2019s milk dried up because she was not eating enough. So we had to find money to buy baby milk. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we will repay it all. I met my wife in the camp, and my daughter was born in the camp- she knows nothing else. We named her Naz\u2019gul, it means beautiful rose, a rose that will bloom in the desert and give us hope. \u201cI used to have a job. I was in a restaurant, but I questioned why I had to work 12 hours a day when the Iraqis were only doing eight hours. In Iraq there is a lot of discrimination and prejudice against refugees, and the boss said, \u2018because you are a refugee. You are nothing, you are a slave.\u2019 \u201cAs a result of asking questions, I lost my job. And now it is hard to find food. it makes life very hard, it makes you feel so small and worthless. I don\u2019t want that for my daughter. \u201cI have tried to leave. We went to the UNHCR but they wouldn\u2019t even hear me, I didn\u2019t even care where we were sent, I just hoped for somewhere with human rights and a future for my child. \u201cThe road to Britain is difficult. I tried to cross the sea, but it is not that easy, and many, many people die, far more than you see in the news. You have to be very brave to go on the boats if you only have a little money. My wife was scared too, because she wondered what would happen to her if I died. That drove the idea from my mind. \u201cI don\u2019t want much; just a future for my child, and the chance to have a job. I\u2019ve a lot of experience in the restaurant and the construction industries, so I am sure I would get a job if I had a chance. \u201cI want to apply for asylum in Iraq but it is impossible, you have to cross the sea first and get to the UK before you can apply. People want to know why the UK- it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s a place that believes in freedom and human rights. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d &nbsp;"}
