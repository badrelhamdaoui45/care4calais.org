And to make sure ministers knew it dozens of campaigners, including Care4Calais, boarded an open-topped London bus and drove to the Houses of Parliament to deliver the message. The analysis found that nearly half of asylum-seekers threatened with deportation to Rwanda are either married or engaged, and a fifth have children. It was also shown that three quarters have fled countries where 82 per cent or more are granted refugee status by the Home Office after reaching Britain. This undermines the government&#8217;s claim that the people being deported are not &#8220;genuine&#8221; refugees. Thirteen people targeted are women, despite assurances that women would not be deported. Three identify as LGBTQ+. Afterwards, we took refugees to meet MPs inside the Houses of Parliament. One was Ali, a 19-year-old Iranian refugee and son of one of the asylum seekers who was almost sent to Rwanda. With great composure and bravery he spoke today to MPs including Conservative Caroline Nokes, Labour&#8217;s Nia Griffith MP and the SNP&#8217;s Stuart McDonald MP about the urgent need to create #SafePassage, and called for them to support the scrapping of the Rwanda plan. The politicians listened to their stories, and said they would take note as they tried to find an answer to the problem of people crossing the channel in small boats. Outside the bus protest continued to make its impact &#8211; on board were Rwandan refugees, actress Juliet Stevenson, comedian Patrick Monahan and many other activists. And the bus was draped in banners urging the the government to \u201cscrap the cruel Rwanda plan\u201d. We deeply hope that Ali and the protest will have persuaded MPs to take on board that the way to stop peoplemugglers and save lives is to give #SafePassageage to refugees in Calais. *Our figures are based on analysis of 213 asylum seekers threatened with deportation to Rwanda."}
