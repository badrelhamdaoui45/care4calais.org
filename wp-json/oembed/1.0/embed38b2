It was really not a nice place &#x2013; there were 400 people there and half got Covid. We slept in rooms with 20 people in them, with only a few blankets between us. It was frightening to be there. The one good thing about Napier was that I was introduced to Care4 Calais, and especially a volunteer called Lily. They really helped us with all sorts of things. Mainly that was shoes and clothes, but sometimes there were other things too. And after a while, I plucked up the courage to make a special request &#x2013; a violin! My name is I&#x2019;m Seyed, I&#x2019;m a 29-year old Iranian Kurd from the Kurdish region Kermanshah of Iran. My people are persecuted in so many lands it is hard to find a safe place to live. My political and religious beliefs differed from those of the government, and it became very difficult for me to stay. I have a big family, I have three sisters but I am the only son. They were able to help me escape, and we found someone who could get me to safety. I didn&#x2019;t know where I was going, that was left up to the smuggler &#x2013; we just paid for the safest place possible. It took a month for me to get to the UK, but I was very happy to be here. However, I missed my family and the times we spent together making music and dancing. I should explain that music is so important in my culture, it&#x2019;s how we express ourselves, socialize and have fun. My brother in law was an expert violin player, he&#x2019;d got me interested a few years ago and while I am not at his level I was pretty good. I didn&#x2019;t play the violin at home I played an instrument called the Taar, which is common in Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. Playing the violin has always been a huge part of my life, and I really missed playing while I was waiting for asylum in the UK. I really missed playing music, it always made me happy. And that&#x2019;s why, after some time, I asked to Lily if she could find me a violin. She said of course she would try but violins were quite rare and often expensive. Over the months I asked her again a few times and she always said she was still looking. Meanwhile I listened to music on my phone, but it wasn&#x2019;t quite the same as playing. Lily posted on social media, and asked friends and other volunteers but no luck. But then in March she heard about a music exhibition in Liverpool from a post on one of the Care4Calais chat groups, and she told them she had a refugee who was very keen on music, and would like a violin. It was amazing, Melodie, another volunteer saw the message and quickly messaged back &#x201C;I may have one&#x201D; I got in touch and she said, &#x201C;I used to play violin and last year I bought one as I wanted to start playing again after a long break but it&#x2019;s just sat in the house gathering dust. So I feel it is meant for Seyed to have&#x201D;. Now, by this time I had been moved to Manchester, but I kept in touch with Lilly. And then to my surprise I got a message from Lily- she said she had found me a violin! I was so happy. The violin didn&#x2019;t quite play as it was missing some parts but I video-called my brother in law and we managed to fix it so I could play. To be able to play the violin makes me feel so happy. I know how hard it was to find and I really appreciate Lily doing this for me when she had so many other people to help; I will never ever forget Lily and the kindness she showed me.</description></oembed>
