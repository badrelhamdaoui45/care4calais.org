I&#x2019;ve been here three months now. It&#x2019;s OK. I have my own house now, I share it with four friends from Africa, Afghan and Iran. It is better then the hotel in some ways as I have my own space, but in the hotel I had lots of Syrian friends and we would sit and talk so much about everything and nothing at all! I do miss that. I left Syria when I was 19 and I am now 29. It has taken me 10 years to get here. I am very scared about my interview. The residency issue always confuses my mind and the thoughts that I may be deported are never far away. I&#x2019;ve already been deported once, from Lebanon, I don&#x2019;t want it to happen again. I can&#x2019;t go through that again. I like to read. It takes my mind off all my problems and I can escape. I have only been learning English for 6 months, so it is still difficult, especially as there are no Arabic books in Stockton library. They said they cannot get me any either, so I am trying my best to learn English very fast! I do read on my phone but I have problems with my eyes, so I really like books better. One of my favourite authors is Agatha Christie. I know her books are old, but her mind is so big and she is so clever. I never know who did it! I remember my mum reading stories to me a long time ago in Syria. That is a nice memory. I liked to write stories too, I still do. I have written about my journey to France. I hope to get it translated one day and then you can read it too. When my residency issue is sorted out, I want to study media, I would like to be a political journalist and continue writing and finding out about the world. I have many friends from Care4Calais, it is the best organisation in the world! They supported me when I needed them and now I want to give something back and volunteer with them in Stockton. &#x2013; Mohammed To support our work go to Care4Calais.org/donate</description></oembed>
