We have been working with a family of four refugees from Ukraine who are travelling with a disabled boy. They don&#x2019;t have any relatives in the UK, and I have been so worried about whether we would be able to help them. Roxy has become my friend and she has been so brave. She is only 22. A lot if reporters were asking me about her, so I suggested that she do an interview to explain her situation. We didn&#x2019;t know if this would help, but I thought it might be worth a try. Incredibly, a journalist called Joe from ITV got in touch to say that after they broadcast the interview, they heard from a family in the UK who have said they will welcome Roxy&#x2019;s family to their home. More than that, they have said that they will convert the hall and bathroom to make them accessible for Roman, her brother. We had a video call with the two families today, and it was unbelieveably moving. I felt so relieved and happy I can&#x2019;t put it into words. The British family were amazing &#x2013; so kind and reassuring. They have five children of their own and their children are now looking forward to meeting Roxy&#x2019;s cat. Their generosity is simply beautiful. There have been so many times in the past when we haven&#x2019;t been able to find answers; to know that this time we might, and a refugee family will now be safe, feels truly wonderful. It&#x2019;s not over yet. Details of how the new sponsorship scheme will work have not been announced and there maybe legal barriers to overcome. But right now we have hope.
