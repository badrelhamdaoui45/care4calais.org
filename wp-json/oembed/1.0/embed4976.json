They were still in their eat-by dates, so we took them out on a food distribution to ask if any of the refugees wanted them. It turned out they really did! In fact They went crazy for them. OK, you might think, if you\u2019re sleeping rough and finding it hard to find food to eat, of course you\u2019re going to go crazy for a little luxury like chocolate. But that wasn\u2019t the whole story. \u201cPick a number, one to 24!\u201d said one guy to me, coming up with a big, door-studded cardboard Santa in his hand. When I chose 12, he found the number 12 compartment, popped it open and handed me the chocolate from inside. I accepted it, and looking around I saw the same routine being played out between other refugees and volunteers: pick a number, pick a number. They weren\u2019t just crazy for the chocolate, they also just wanted the chance to share. We forget how hard it is to be on the receiving end of charity constantly, having something that you can give to someone else is so important for our self esteem. Having 24 mini chocolates meant they could offer us some and share with us, and it created a brilliant atmosphere as we all laughed and tucked into the tiny chocolate snowman, robins and stars there on that bleak site in northern France. It was one of those moments when the work Care4Calais does helps to restore a little bit of human dignity to people, and it made me feel truly proud of the work our organisation does.
