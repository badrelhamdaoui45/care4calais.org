If you heard the Home Secretary\u2019s speech about this government\u2019s plans for immigration last week, you may have heard her bragging about \u201csmall boat related prosecutions.\u201d She meant the trial and imprisonment of people caught driving small boats across the English Channel. Since the start of 2020 there have been 65 such prosecutions. Patel wants you to think it\u2019s people smugglers being locked up. But it isn\u2019t. From long experience in northern France, we know that the smugglers don\u2019t cross with their customers. They just provide the boats and information &#8211; and profit handsomely from desperation. But not everyone has money to pay smugglers. Some attempting the crossing agree to drive the boat as a way to negotiate passage, and it is these desperate risk-takers that the courts have been prosecuting, and that Priti Patel proclaims \u201csmugglers.\u201d Caught on a technicality, they generally accept plea bargains, and serve between two and five years in prison. After which, of course, they are unlikely to be granted asylum. However, a few days before Patel\u2019s speech, Fouad Kakaei, who is 31 and from Iran, proved the fallacy of her claim. Fouad had earlier won the right to appeal his own small boat prosecution. At the retrial, he won and walked free. Fouad\u2019s legal team argued that he was not trying to enter the UK illegally. People crossing the channel like this aren\u2019t. Knowing that there\u2019s next to no chance of actually reaching the UK, they want to be intercepted by border patrols. Border patrols, they know, will take them to a recognised port of entry where they are legally entitled to claim asylum. We\u2019re proud to say that our founder Clare Moseley was called on to provide expert testimony at the trial. She was able to call on the kind of on-the-ground experience that carries so much weight in situations such as this, demonstrating again the importance of our work. \u201cI personally know well at least three men who have taken the role of driver in order to get in a boat to cross to the Channel,\u201d Clare told the court. \u201cIn every case they were an \u2018ordinary\u2019 refugee with no motivation other than to get to the UK and claim asylum. However, none of them had any money to do this, and so they felt that this was their only option.\u201d And we\u2019re delighted to say that the case was so clear that the jury unanimously cleared Fouad of all charges in just four hours. Fouad\u2019s lawyer Aneurin Brewer, told the Guardian that the case could change history. \u201cThe individuals on the boat were intending to be rescued at sea and were not planning to disembark and enter illegally. That means there was no breach of immigration law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis verdict throws into serious doubt the viability of future prosecutions. \u201cA large number of cases had been paused while this specific case was resolved and it is difficult to see now how they can go ahead. It also raises very serious questions over the convictions that have been secured to date including migrants who are serving significant prison sentences. \u201cThere are individuals who pleaded guilty but who will now be potentially able to go to the court of appeal.\u201d In future, Patel may not only find herself unable to announce fewer prosecutions. She may also have to admit the ones the Crown Prosecution Service secured were unjust. To support our work go to care4calais.org\/donate."}
