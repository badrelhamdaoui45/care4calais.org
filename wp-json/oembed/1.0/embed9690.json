The family are Christian, which made life in Iran dangerous for them. The authorities constantly intimidated and threatened them, so finally they made a big decision together. Ashraf and Ali would make the incredibly dangerous journey to seek asylum in the UK and, if successful, bring Ali\u2019s mum and his two sisters \u2013 the three of them are triplets \u2013 to join them. It was hard for Ali to leave his mother and two sisters. Triplets share a special bond and they are very close, but he felt he had to do it to save them all.\u00a0 He and his father first made a dangerous crossing through the mountains to Turkey, then passed through Greece and Italy on their way to northern France. They had hoped to get a boat to the UK together, but they only had \u00a0enough money for one of them.\u00a0 Ashraf told Ali to go ahead, and he would follow soon after.\u00a0 It meant living rough in Calais, but he stuck it out, and finally got a place in a boat; however, it sank and Ashraf, in serious danger of drowning, \u00a0had to be pulled from the cold sea by rescuers. Two months passed before Ashraf managed to get across the Channel, but then, just at the point when he thought he\u2019d see his son again, he was locked in detention and told the British government was sending him to Rwanda. The shock and despair of being told this by a government that you had thought would offer you safety was unimaginable. Since that moment Ashraf had been living in a waking hell. \u00a0 Unable to help his family after taking so many risks to find safely for them, with no control over his future and no hope to offer to his wife, he considered taking his own life. Throughout this time Ali was living in an asylum hotel in the north of England. He was in a strange new town, constantly fretting about the dad who \u201cmeans everything to me.\u201d Sharing news with his mum and sisters as best he could, he was never able to relax, not even able to breathe properly: \u201cthese two months have felt like two years.\u201d When we finally went to the high court on 13 June, Ali and Ashraf were in our minds all day. When the shock of British judges denying our appeal sank in, we realised we would have to phone and tell them first. We couldn\u2019t bear for them to hear it on the news. But what awful phone calls to have to make. The day of the flight was even worse. Our volunteers were in touch with both men up to the last few hours, when Ashraf was locked in the back of a van and his phone was taken away. But then amazing news. The European Court of Human Rights had stopped the flight.\u00a0 There are no words to describe the overwhelming relief everyone felt. It was as if there was light in the world again. The next morning the first thing we did was to make arrangements to get Ali down to see his father.\u00a0 By midday Ali was on the train to London. Our volunteer Tristan was there to meet him and took him to get food and to a hotel for the night. The next morning they set off to meet Ashraf at his detention centre, with Ali feeling elated and excited. Thanks to our amazing volunteers, an overjoyed Ali hugged his dad again, both men overcome with relief, happiness and a feeling of safety. \u201cIt was a really amazing feeling to see my father after two months,\u201d he told Tristan afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s great to know that he is here and that I can tell my family he is fine. Now there is no stress again, there is hope, and I feel that I will not give up. Meeting my father was the best moment of being in the UK so far. \u201cI&#8217;ll never forget this week because of everything that happened. After this I\u2019ll always keep it in my mind not to forget how amazing the feeling is when you have freedom and be with your family. \u201cIt is not just about me and my father, but all our family. My mom and my sisters in Iran are very happy too &#8211; because we are together again, they are not worried about us any more.\u201c \u201cThe meeting was every bit as emotional as you would expect,\u201d says Tristan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to ask yourself why this family has been put through this needless nightmare in the first place. It\u2019s a very stark reminder of just how callous and barbaric this whole scheme is.\u201d Ali says that he\u2019s learned something positive from this whole dark experience. Because of the support of people like Tristan and other Care4Calais supporters, he says, he has realised that humanity is still here and there are a lot of people who still care about refugees. Now he is sure that he will never be alone again, and that makes him really, really happy. \u201cThese people are different,\u201d he says. \u201dI love them. They are my family. I mean that with all my heart.\u201d We are challenging the government\u2019s Rwanda policy in court in July, and we need your help more than ever.
