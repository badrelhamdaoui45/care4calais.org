Its simplicity is incredibly moving \u2013 and a reminder that the refugees who will be affected by this barbaric Rwanda plan are only seeking safety. We&#8217;re receiving pictures from places all around the world now, the sheer numbers of people showing the sheer scale of opposition to the UK Government&#8217;s callous scheme. People everywhere are united in demanding that the flights are stopped and the whole idea replaced with a plan for refugees that is sensible and humane. It was great news that our court case against the plan has been adjourned to September, giving us more time to build the campaign and show people&#8217;s refusal to accept the plan. Right now we\u2019re using all the support we&#8217;ve been getting for the campaign to make as much as noise as possible, to make sure the Government knows the strength of public opposition. In September we will be in the High Court to challenge the lawfulness of the plan, and in the run up to that date we need your support. Here&#8217;s what you can do to help: Download or make a #StopRwanda card and take picture of yourself and\/or your friends holding it.
