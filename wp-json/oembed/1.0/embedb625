We made various suggestions, but one of them laughed and said no, no and then he thought for a bit and said, I know, I want a Bob Marley &#x2013; one, red gold and green. Bob Marley is always popular with the guys here and you sometimes hear them talk about him. Anyway, they were soon deep in quiet concentration weaving /plaiting the bands, making sure they kept them neat and straight. Two of them were working on a Bob-inspired design whilst another made a slimmer one using the red and white colours inspired by the Sudanese flag. We&#x2019;ve been offering friendship-bracelet-making on the bike stall for a few weeks now. In a way it might not seem a big deal to someone looking in from the outside but when you don&#x2019;t have much, small things can have a bigger meanings, and this is a way of interacting with people, talking about something different apart from the daily grind of life as a refugee in Calais. That little bit of self-expression makes a difference. The refugees and volunteers enjoy it &#x2013; It usually takes an hour or so to make a bracelet, you can do it together without knowing much of each others language, and its nice that there&#x2019;s something physical at the end of it. The support we provide isn&#x2019;t just about basic necessities, friendship is a big part of it too, and these small bracelets are little symbols of that. As we finished up a nice fat Marley-esque number today. it made us all consider what else we could do and I plan to get a few more colours to bring back next week. Maybe we should get some black and white to get working on some #StopRwanda versions!</description></oembed>
