He was hoping to cross by boat to the UK. He had tried to cross a few weeks ago, but the boat had got into trouble just off the French coast and he had been rescued. Naively, I asked if he wasn&#x2019;t now afraid to try. &#x201C;Yes of course,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I am scared. We are all scared. But what else can we do?&#x201D; He indicated a friend a few metres away and told me that he had been in three boats that had gone down. Destan had been a journalist in Kurdistan. He had bravely written stories exposing corruption among local and foreign organisations in his country. Death threats had become familiar to him. &#x201C;I wrote the stories because I love my country and I love my people. The people I wrote about were taking money from them, and they didn&#x2019;t want to lose that money, so yes of course they wanted to kill me.&#x201D; Eventually he had to leave. He had written a story about a very corrupt property deal, and those involved came to his home to get him. Fortunately, he was out, and he left the next day. He made a cut-throat gesture and laughed. &#x201C;If not &#x2013; this!&#x201D; I was struck by how close and real the risk of dying had become for Destan. He couldn&#x2019;t go back because certain death awaited him. His only hope lay with friends in the UK who would shelter him. The mortal risk of crossing in a small boat had become his only option. When I get home after volunteering in Calais and meeting guys like Destan, it makes me mad as hell when I hear the media talking about refugees getting into small boats as if they&#x2019;ve weighed up all the options and made a choice. It&#x2019;s as if they were deciding where to go on a nice little mini-break. In fact, they do it for one reason only &#x2013; it&#x2019;s their only choice. You can help refugees like Destan by volunteering or making a donation. Please go to care4calais.org/get-involved/</description></oembed>
