It&#x2019;s almost like they are saying to the police, &#x201C;you will not beat us, see our spirit and our courage, we will survive.&#x201D; I haven&#x2019;t been brave enough to join them yet, but I really hope I will soon. I&#x2019;m Claire from the Netherlands and I&#x2019;ve been volunteering with Care4Calais &#xA0;for a while now. What really sets C4C apart from the other NGOs is the services. The organisation doesn&#x2019;t just drop off items of clothing, food, toiletries, but stays on the site for three hours and delivers a hair station (so they can cut hair and trim beards), a sewing station, a bike station, a phone charging station, hot drinks, and games. It is during services that you get to talk to the guys in depth and really get to know them. It offers a way for the refugees to temporarily relax and play a simple game of jenga or teach volunteers some Arabic. This, I think, really sets C4C apart, and it has made my experience incredibly rewarding. I study sociology and social anthropology at university, and immigration is the area in which I was most interested in throughout university. The thought of people not being able to have a home, and all policy being directed to keeping these people away just shocked me. Coming from the Netherlands, I was so disappointed in my own countries immigration laws and when I started to look up more and more about the policies other countries, I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. I had to see it with my own eyes, so that&#x2019;s why I decided to come to Calais, and to write my dissertation on this topic. It&#x2019;s made me realise I want a more concrete skillset to actually be able to change something about the situation of these refugees. I am now planning on doing a law conversion at the end of my degree to make sure I get a law degree as well. Hopefully, I can then continue in human rights law and international law. But it&#x2019;s not all singing and games here, warehouse work can be very tiring but I really understand why it&#x2019;s super necessary. The distributions need to be prepared, donations need to be sorted, and there is just no way of doing this job without that warehouse work. I love the balance of doing warehouse jobs in the morning and going to a site in the afternoon, it keeps the job varied. And, I can now say I know how to efficiently fold up a tent and a sleeping bag, I know how to use a pallet truck and I have definitely had my fitness sessions in with lifting boxes! The team here is AMAZING! I&#x2019;ve gotten along with everyone on the team and we&#x2019;ve become so close. I think the way Care4Calais works is super efficient and organised, which makes the job a lot better to handle! The team leaders are such lovely people as well. On your first day you get a super extensive briefing about how everything works, and you&#x2019;re always encouraged to ask questions. But I stay because of the refugees these guys have just been the most positive, uplifting and kind people I have every had the pleasure to meet. They always make me laugh, and I have gotten on with every single one of them. It has been so eye-opening to hear their life stories, and to just provide them with a bit of fun and distraction. I think I may even have persuaded my mum to come and volunteer soon! &#x2013; Claire, volunteer in Calais To support our work go to care4calais.org/donate</description></oembed>
