The play was fast and skilful, the passion was palpable and players and supporters alike loved every second. Ok, it wasn&#x2019;t Arsenal &#x2013; Man City, or Man U &#x2013; Liverpool. It was in fact the long-awaited local derby between Basingstoke Care4Calais FC v Reading Care4Calais FC, with teams of refugees and volunteers competing for bragging rights. Lots of the refugees we help adore football and it&#x2019;s easy to see why. However good you are, when you&#x2019;re out on that pitch it&#x2019;s just you, your mates and that ball; everyone&#x2019;s equal and, with a bit of luck, anyone can score. The players at the weekend loved the feeling of release and freedom it gave them. &#x201C;It felt like the first time I could properly breathe since I arrived here,&#x201D; one guy said. This match was taking place as football players, managers and pundits lined up to back Gary Lineker&#x2019;s criticism of the Government&#x2019;s anti-refugee rhetoric, and it made me think about why football had sided so strongly with someone sticking up for refugees. Could it be that football &#x2013; unlike, say politics &#x2013; is quite likely to give you a chance based on your ability, not who you are or where you came from? After all, plenty of top players have been refugees themselves. Chelsea didn&#x2019;t mind that Victor Moses had come to the UK from Nigeria to claim asylum, and Real Madrid were happy to have Luka Modri&#x107; on their side after he and his family fled their home in Croatia. They asked for a chance and were given it irrespective of where they came from. That&#x2019;s the polar opposite of this Government&#x2019;s approach to refugees, which disregards all individual talent or ability and denies a chance to almost everyone except a hand-picked few. And yet funnily enough football seems to be coping rather well. No wonder people took its side against the Government&#x2019;s at the weekend. And no wonder we won. Back on the hallowed turf of the Thames Valley, Basingstoke C4C FC won by a handsome margin, but the return is eagerly anticipated. For Reading C4C FC and for all of us &#x2013; there is hope.
