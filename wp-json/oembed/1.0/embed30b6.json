We were given the sad news by his friends this morning. Having survived unknown horrors in his home country, and a gruelling journey to get here in search of safety, it is devastating to hear that it is in the UK that he met his end. Our volunteers also knew this young man for a few months of his journey while he was in Calais. He lived under one of the bridges in the city centre. One of our team leaders described him as happy and jokey, saying that every time she saw him he would shout over and give her a fist bump and say hello. He used to pretend to jump in and out of the distribution line for a joke. He didn\u2019t speak much English but every time she saw him they would \u2018laugh, even without words\u2019. This follows the inquest in May into the death in another London hotel of a man from the Ivory Coast. The inquest concluded natural causes but the mans friends remain unhappy as he had requested an ambulance multiple times before being discovered dead in his room. Last year in August Abdullah from Yemen died in a Manchester hotel. The mans friends are pictured here. They are upset as they have been given no information about his death or about what will happen to his body. As with previous deaths of asylum seekers facts are hard to come by. Our local volunteers are supporting the friends through this difficult time."}
