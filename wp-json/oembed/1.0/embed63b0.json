Every time you overcame one challenge, another one, higher and faster, came at you, and you just had to hunch down and face it.\u201d Gamar\u2019s journey from Darfur in Sudan to Birmingham in the UK has been arduous and horrific. Once a teacher in Sudan, he first made his escape across the Sahara, where he saw grotesque sights including dead bodies scattered and decomposing in the sun. Then he crossed Libya, where he was assaulted, tortured and held for ransom. He made it to Italy and France before finally being forced to make a nightmare crossing to the UK in a refrigerated truck. Such experiences are beyond what most of us can imagine, but he has described them brilliantly and movingly in a book \u201cA Tale of a Refugee\u201d, published by UK Book Publishing and now available on Amazon. \u201cI needed to get it out of my head and onto paper,\u201d he says, \u201cI wrote it so that people will know that journeys like mine are not easy.\u201d Most of the books that I buy are on Africa and the refugee crisis, but this one is really special. I knew Gamar back in 2016, when I was volunteering with Care4Calais in the Calais Jungle. Gamar made it to the UK just as the Jungle was razed to the ground. I remembered that like many, he had nothing when he got here except a big personality and a willingness to help others. After reading his moving book, I picked up my phone and gave him a call to ask where the last six years had gone, and how he was doing. \u201cWhen I got to the UK I knew I was safe, but after a while you begin to think about what you have been through. \u201cYou miss home and your family. I began to feel really down and sad. I was lonely, it was a hard time, but I knew others had had it much harder than me. I decided everyone needed to know why people become refugees and what the journey is like, not only physically but emotionally. \u201cAs a refugee, your emotions are like another rollercoaster that churns your stomach. You wonder what\u2019s happening back home: will your people miss you? Have you made a mistake? Who will take care of them? \u201cBut you know that if you\u2019d stayed, you\u2019d be dead. It all goes round in your head all the time.\u201d Having been granted asylum, Gamar now has his own house, and has been reunited with his wife and children, one of whom was a small baby when he left Sudan. Looking at him now, you would never know there was such a story behind this kind, smiling man. He\u2019s been busy in other ways too. \u201cI joined the Birmingham Opera \u2013that is such fun, and I really came to like the music! It is just so different from Sudanese music. Lizzie from Care4Calais, a brilliant opera singer, introduced me to it. \u201cI\u2019ve also finished my Masters degree from Aston University and did quite a bit of interpreting to help other refugees. \u201cHaving been a teacher back in Sudan, I knew that\u2019s what I want to do here \u2013 although I really, really wanted to be a diplomat. \u201cOf course I miss Sudan, it was my home. I miss the sun and spending lazy days by the White Nile swimming, eating Sudanese food and just socializing. We\u2019d sing and dance together \u2013 those are happy memories, and recalling them makes me feel very melancholy. \u201cBut I am here now and safe. You know that\u2019s really all people want \u2013 security and peace. When you read my book you\u2019ll see how important that is. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t undertake my journey if life in Darfur was safe.\u201d If you would like to understand more of the journey a refugee must take to get to the UK, \u201cA Tale of a Refugee\u201d by Gamar Abdulrahman is on sale now at Amazon priced \u00a37.99."}
