I came to the UK because it is safe, and I speak English. It&#x2019;s a fair country, and I knew I&#x2019;d have a chance here. Last week I got my refugee status after two years of waiting, and today I picked up my card! I grew up in Uganda. There are four of us in my family, and my father died when I was quite young so my mother brought us up. I went to a good school in Kampala with a lot of international students. That&#x2019;s where my love of language began. I speak six languages: English, Arabic, Japanese, Swahili, Kikuyu, Taita, Portuguese, and some Chinese. French and German are next on my list to learn now I have asylum. Overall I did well in school. I went to university in Nairobi to study cyber security management, and I got a good job when I finished. Everything was fine, but then something really bad happened, and I had to leave. I cannot talk about that, it is too hard. My journey here was also very traumatic and I cannot bear to think about. Being an asylum seeker is difficult. After you&#x2019;re processed you&#x2019;re given a room, a duvet, a mattress, and a few cooking utensils, nothing else. For two years I lived on &#xA3;37 a week. It&#x2019;s hard, but you just have to do it. If you have a roof over your head and somewhere to sleep you will survive. What reality helped was when I was in a hotel last year, and I met a wonderful woman called Pauline. She was outside our hotel in Runcorn one night. She had brought things for the refugees in the hotel, and I talked with her, and I&#x2019;ve been helping her ever since. She is my friend now. Now with my card I can start my life again. I&#x2019;ll wait to see where God takes me, but there are so many things I&#x2019;d like to do. I&#x2019;d quite like to be a nurse, as I really like helping people. I cannot talk about the past. I wish I could erase it. But please understand how much I love my country and the family I left. And please be kind to refugees; you do not know what we have had to leave behind us.
