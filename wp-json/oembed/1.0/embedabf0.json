Cases of malnutrition among both children and adults have been confirmed in various different areas of England, including hotels in London and in the south-west. Health professionals have raised concerns, with some children at hotels becoming dangerously thin and in need of frequent monitoring. One Syrian mother whom Care4Calais supports is in a London hotel with her family. \u201cSeeing my children lose weight in the hotel is breaking my heart. Children are supposed to gain weight as they grow not lose it.\u201d \u201cMy three-year-old daughter has lost a lot of weight since we arrived. She only weighs 13 kilos now. When we ask for milk for the children they don\u2019t always give it to us and the milk we do get looks like it\u2019s mixed with water. We\u2019re given rice swimming in water and stinky chicken.\u201d &nbsp; Those working with families in hotels reported that some parents have been found rummaging through bins to find food for their children and adults were losing as much as 10-15kg (22-33lbs) of weight."}
