As a kid, Abdullah would look at the people helping and admire them.\u00a0 &#8220;Starting then, when I was very young,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I wanted to work for an organisation like that when I grew up.&#8221; &nbsp; However, one day when he was in his late teens, Abdullah was on his father&#8217;s farm in West Darfur when the Janjaweed militia came and seized him. He was held captive with 15 other people, one of whom was killed; luckily Abdullah managed to escape, and made his way to the nearby city of Geneina. There he met people who were going to Libya, and left Sudan with them. &nbsp; It was the start of a horrific three-year journey."}
