I did not work for the army, I was just a mechanic but now I\u2019m also a target. We cannot got home, but we cannot go forward either. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, and day by day things get worse. We don\u2019t go outside anymore, just stay in this small room, with our neighbours trying to help us.\u201d These are the words of Ali, an Afghan man currently trapped in Quetta, Pakistan. When I spoke to him last night, he sounded terrified. At a time when Priti Patel is trying to use fear to deter refugees from crossing to the UK, his story is a reminder of the fear that drives many to come, and how Rwanda deprives people of that most valuable thing &#8211; hope. \u201cEven if I could find the money and a way to get to the UK I do not want to come now\u201d, he told me. \u201cBecause your government will send me to Rwanda. Why would I want to go there? I do not want to live the rest of my life in a camp with no opportunities for a job.\u201d Ali left Khandahar in Afghanistan in 2020 after the Taliban badly injured his brother, attacked Ali in his own house. His brother fled to Turkey, and Ali took his sister-in-law and nieces and nephews to over the border to Pakistan. \u201cMy brother was a staff sergeant in the British army for many years. He worked mostly in a regional training centre for the police. So he was a high-value target for the Taliban. \u201cIn 2020 Afghanistan was in a high state of war and there was a lot of killings. They planted a bomb for my brother, and he lost his jaw in the explosion. \u201cHe was in hospital a long time, but he knew next time they would kill him, so he left for Turkey as soon as he could. \u201cThen they attacked me. I was left with a broken arm that will not heal. it is still in plaster now, and very painful. \u201cI knew my brothers wife and children and I were not safe, so we left for Quetta in Pakistan. That is where there are a lot of Afghans who fled during the Russian war of 1979. I thought we would be safe here, but we are not.\u201d The Quetta area is full of Taliban scouts and a lot of the Taliban still live there. \u201cThe Taliban patrol the area looking for Afghan refugees and the police help them. If the police catch us they put you in jail and then send you back to Afghanistan. The caught me a while back and put me in prison, at the time my friend had money so he paid the bribe to get me out, but now I can\u2019t be caught again or they will send me back or kill me. Then what will my family do? \u201cAbout eight months ago I started hearing that the Taliban were searching my area for me, they had my name. Then we got official Taliban letters saying if you do not tell us where your brother is, we will kill you. I will not give up my brother, so now I am hiding. We do not go outside and we have moved maybe 10 or 12 places in the last two years. \u201cIslamabad is much safer but I do not have money to go there or to get out of Pakistan. My friend in the UK helped me get my visa for Pakistan and I have many letters of support from international friends, but no one can help us. We are in a very bad way. \u201c Ali\u2019s brother is now in Turkey and relative safety but he is illegal there and can not get a good job. When he can he send money back to the family but its never enough. \u201cI am in a bad way here,\u201d he says. \u201cI can not see away out, everyday my family are hungry and thirsty , we rely on our neighbours to bring us food and water but it is never enough as they do not have a lot for themselves\u201d So many people have been left in terrible straits in Afghanistan, and so many have fled to Pakistan hoping of getting out of the area. They are caught in limbo with no way forward and no way back. Even with money and a healed arm, finding his way to safety with his brother\u2019s family would be a very dangerous for Ali. Often, what sustains people in these situations is hope \u2013 the belief that if they can somehow find a way out, fellow humans somewhere will give them help, and offer refuge. The denial of that hope is yet another cruel effect of this government\u2019s Rwanda plan, and further proof of its barbarity. To volunteer or donate go to care4calais.org"}
