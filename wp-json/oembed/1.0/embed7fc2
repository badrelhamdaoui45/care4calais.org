My family were inside at the time, but luckily they escaped. But something like this could happen again, even after we had fled to stay with a family member. I kept my head down for eight months, but then I was summoned to trial, and I knew that I would be imprisoned or worse.&#xA0; My wife begged me to run, to leave Iraq. I had never in my life imagined being in this position. But nowhere was safe. I had to do something. My name is Agrin. I am a 51-year-old Iraqi national from the IKR. I work as a senior lawyer and a journalist, and I&#x2019;m married &#x2013; my wife worked as a lawyer for Iraq&#x2019;s Justice Department &#x2013; and we have three children. Until 2018, we also had a beautiful family home. In 2013 I became head partner of my law firm and began to take on controversial cases against Kurdish government &#x2013; cases that involved senior politicians and even the President of Iraq. These cases were blocked and barred and I began to receive threats. By&#xA0; 2016 those threats had become serious, and it was clear to me that the judicial system itself was corrupt. My wife was forced to leave her job, and I had to close my offices. Some of my staff lawyers moved away for safety because of the threats and intimidation.&#xA0; I continued to work, but quietly. I also began to publish articles exposing corruption, always with documented evidence. I was arrested and imprisoned, but was released thanks to a campaign by political journalists. There remained a pending court case against me, but political journalism was now my passion and I continued to write and publish details of the corruption. There are YouTube videos of me on national television debates, giving evidence and proof of a number of fraudulent&#xA0; cases as well as embezzlement by the government. Of course this made me a great enemy of the IKR, which is why they firebombed my house.&#xA0; After lying low for eight months I realised I&#x2019;d have to flee, and thought of my brother who lives in London.&#xA0; He is an engineer and a German national who has lived and worked in Europe for more than 22 years. I wanted to be with him. As a I&#x2019;m a lawyer and a journalist I never in my life imagined that, one day I would have to catch a bus to Turkey, a boat across the Mediterranean and hide in the back of a lorry to reach safety. But that&#x2019;s what I did. I arrived in December 2020 and I submitted every piece of evidence to the Home Office, proving who I am and why I had to leave. I am still awaiting my HO Interview, and I have been living in a hotel all this time. I worry about my family, In particular my son who is coming of age and may become a target for the IKR government. I love to help people, and&#xA0; I pass my days volunteering with food banks, the Felix Project food charity in London, and a community kitchen. &#xA0; It helps me stop worrying.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve seen how the mental health of many asylum seekers can decline &#x2013; even strong tenacious, enthusiastic people with lots to offer can lose their will to live.&#xA0; I miss my own country, but it is impossible for me to return. They will take my life. I do not expect the British Government to pay for my accommodation or living expenses &#x2013; I&#x2019;m fit and healthy, and I have means and an education. I don&#x2019;t want benefits; on the contrary I have a lot I would like to offer this country. But I do need safety and to be allowed&#xA0; to work.
