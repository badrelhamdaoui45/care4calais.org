I wouldn&#x2019;t normally come, to be honest. But there comes a point where you feel you want to do something, and say, not in my name.&#x201D; Just up ahead of me I watched an older man with a stick. He walked the length of the demo without taking a break. Ordinary people can be deeply inspiring when they quietly stand up for their beliefs. On the back of his T shirts was Desmond Tutu&#x2019;s famous quote: &#x201C;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.&#x201D; It seemed very fitting. Thousands of people marched through London today. Our volunteers proudly marched side by side with refugees. There was such a feeling warmth and support between us all that the recent Government rhetoric about refugees was shown up for the vile toxic confection that it is. Days like today are there to give you inspiration and strength. Inspiration like the dumpster truck and black cab drivers, tooting their horns and giving us the thumbs up as we walked down Regents Street. Inspiration like Ruth (she&#x2019;s there in the pictures) who brought her shopping trolley to the demonstration so she she could carry more signs. (She told us she&#x2019;d been protesting injustice for years, &#x201C;but I&#x2019;ve rarely seen a head of steam building up like this is building up against this new refugee bill&#x201D;). And inspiration like Soran, one of the refugees we support, who said &#x201C;Many politicians work by telling us were not the same as humans. Days like today are when we say, &#x2018;Yes we are.'&#x201D; (Respect too to the marcher who tried valiantly to get the chant &#x201C;Suella! Cruella! Worse than salmonella!&#x201D; going. Keep persevering.) Thank you to all our supporters and all the refugees who came today. Let&#x2019;s keep on giving each other strength.
