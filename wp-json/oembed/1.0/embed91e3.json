It\u2019s either at a park or community centre, and it\u2019s like a party that makes everyone feel happy and welcome for days. Last week I asked someone how it got started. The answer, as is so often the case in the Midlands, was simply \u201cKaram\u201d. Karam coordinates Care4Calais work in the East Midlands, and she\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s not just the huge amount of work she does, it\u2019s also the way she inspires people and brings them together. No Care4Calais group in Nottingham for her to join? OK, she\u2019ll start one. No volunteers living near a hotel housing refugees? Well then she\u2019ll message a friendly-looking local Facebook group. As a result she now has a hard-working network all over her area. \u201cShe once told me there were lots of like-minded groups who didn\u2019t know each other,\u201d one volunteer told me. \u201cSo if you got volunteers to make contact and work together, it was the best way of leveraging your time to grow your numbers. She\u2019s such a kind, warm-hearted person, but she\u2019s also got an amazing eye for organising things like that.\u201d She began volunteering in the first COVID lockdown, when she heard refugees in hotels were barely being allowed out of their rooms. This was not only unfair, it breached their human rights; determined to do something about it, she began visiting hotels. Managers were sometimes hostile at first, but naturally she won them round and soon she was taking people out, then organising distributions of essential items. Once when she was giving out mobile phones she\u2019d collected, the police came to investigate; by the time she\u2019d explained, they were congratulating her on the work she was doing. The network she has helped to build up has been incredibly important in the last few months, when the far right has been active in the region. Karam isn\u2019t directly involved in every pro-refugee demonstration, but as another volunteer says, \u201cshe always replies quickly, and has good advice and ideas about what to do.\u201d She is also as reliable as a rock. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t shout about what she\u2019s doing from the rooftops, which is easy to do. But she always, always sees a job through, and when you\u2019re working with refugees, you have to do that. When it comes to helping people get to their interviews or fixing something at their accommodation, Karam will either be there herself, or talking to someone to give them advice on how to help.\u201d And what motivates her? \u201cJust that the refugees you meet are so amazing that you want to carry on helping them, and that there are so many others who want to welcome them,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to remember there are lots of people from all walks of life who support refugees, and are willing to help if you ask. They all understand that the only way to defeat hate is with love.\u201d"}
