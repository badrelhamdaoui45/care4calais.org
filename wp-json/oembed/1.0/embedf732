I was sorting shoes and trainers that have been donated to refugees when I came across this little handwritten note stuck in a pair of boys school shoes. &#x201C;My name is Mark,&#x201D; it read. &#x201C;And I really do hope that these shoes go a long way to changing your life.&#x201D; Just a few words, but a moment of thoughtfulness that says a lot about the compassion of the young man who had sent them. Refugees have often had to leave their homeland with nothing but the clothes on their back, and because they are forced to walk long distances their shoes often wear out. So to get a new pair can make a really huge difference to someone. They&#x2019;re not just more comfortable and dry, they all bring a bit of dignity too. I could imagine them bringing a smile back to the face of someone, and when they saw that note, they would know that someone in their new home country cared. As a volunteer with CareCalais I&#x2019;m constantly touched by how generous people are, and to see this kindness really moved me and gave me hope. We are hugely thankful for Sal&#x2019;s Shoes, the charity that helped these shoes and many more besides reach us. They specialise in &#x201C;finding new feet for preloved children&#x2019;s shoes&#x201D;, to use their lovely description, and they do amazing work helping us with footwear for the young refugees we help. We&#x2019;d like to express our gratitude to everyone at Sal&#x2019;s here. And, of course, we&#x2019;d like to add a special thank you to you, Mark.
