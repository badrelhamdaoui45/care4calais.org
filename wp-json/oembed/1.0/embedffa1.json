Many of them were understandably upset. At ages when they should have been in school and supported by Children\u2019s Services, they were living in hotels surrounded by men far older than themselves. And all alone in a strange new country, they had no way of doing anything about it. So, in March 2022 we launched our dedicated Age Disputes team. The volunteers in our team work incredibly hard to provide support to the young people we meet. We call every single individual and discuss what happened to them on arrival and how we can help. We explain the asylum process, and refer them to Children\u2019s Services and solicitors who help as they dispute the age wrongly assigned to them. We also stay in touch with the young person through the many months that it can take for their age to be corrected, and for the right support to be provided. This is so important, because they\u2019re often frightened and traumatised, and we\u2019re the only friend they can turn to. I run the team, and I\u2019m in awe of the dedication and compassion of our volunteers. It feels like an achievement to have supported so many young people since October 2021, but also so wrong, because if refugees were treated fairly, this team wouldn\u2019t need to exist at all. Rebecca, Care4Calais Right now we\u2019re recruiting new volunteers for our Age Dispute team. If you could help, please go to\u00a0care4calais.org\/get-involved\/supporting-refugees-in-the-uk\/"}
