Many of these refugees were caught in the horrific bombings so our help has never felt more important. We received a call from Border Force at around 12, asking if we could help with supplies of essentials. Our volunteers went into action immediately, using the donations we\u2019ve received this week to order what was needed from wholesalers. By mid-afternoon a hired van was speeding its way to the airport loaded with boxes of baby food, toiletries, colouring books for children, 1000 blankets and hundeds of phone chargers. By 4.30pm it had all been dropped off, ready to be collected by the refugees as soon as they arrived. We don\u2019t know yet where they will be housed, but we do at least know they will have these essentials. Many of them will arrive with nothing, so having these vital things can help them to feel a human again \u2013 and let them know that people here care. Today we have dropped off hundreds of head scarves for the women and prayer mats as these were a particular request, and our volunteers are hard at work making up individual clothes packs for each refugee as they literally escaped with nothing. We are proud to know we have helped, and proud too to be part of an incredible collective effort by our fantastic supporters and many other caring, compassionate people.
