I live in Germany and I&#8217;ve just returned from three weeks volunteering with Care4Calais. &nbsp; When I went there, I was expecting the refugees I met to be people in need. Instead I met the bravest, strongest and most impressive people you can ever imagine. &nbsp; My reasons for volunteering in Calais this summer were many, but they come down to one simple fact: it is nothing but a coincidence where, and under which circumstances, someone is born. And since the European Union is failing completely in regard to the interaction with refugees, I felt it was my duty to stand at the refugees&#8217; side and show solidarity. &nbsp; But I found there is a world of difference between knowing about the refugees&#8217; situation here in Calais, and then seeing it with your own eyes, and listening to the stories the refugees tell you about their journey. &nbsp; Once you&#8217;ve got to know some of the people living there, it&#8217;s really hard to go back to your normal life. That&#8217;s why I changed my plans in order to extend my stay in Calais for a few more days. To be honest, I wish I could have stayed forever! &nbsp; I\u2019m so grateful for everything I&#8217;ve learnt in Calais \u2013 no book or documentary could ever teach you what I have learnt. I am also very thankful for all the great, lovely and inspiring people I&#8217;ve got to know \u2013 the refugees as well as the other volunteers. &nbsp; So many strong people who risk their life on dangerous routes due to the lack of safe passages to achieve what should be a given right for everybody. &nbsp; So many wholeheartedly committed people who are not willing to accept the injustices of the world. &nbsp; It\u2019s the people I&#8217;ve met while volunteering with Care4Calais who made this experience unforgettable; and they\u2019re definitely the main reason I will be returning as soon as possible. &nbsp; Sarah, Care4Calais volunteer, Calais &nbsp; We urgently need more volunteers like Sarah to help refugees and asylum seekers.
