Last October Sani got in a small boat to cross to the UK. As soon as the boat was out at sea, she saw a big ship coming towards them, and thought they would all be killed. \u201cOne man on board went crazy and started unscrewing the cap to let the air out of the dinghy,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI shouted \u2018You are crazy! Put that back!\u2019\u201d Partly thanks to her good sense, they all made it here, and she applied for asylum. Sani had left Iran, where she worked as a firefighter, because her family tried to kill her when she changed her religion to Christianity. Her own brother tried to run her off the road when she was out driving. She had to leave her son from her previous marriage, and cross through Turkey, Greece. \u201c Then I walked with a group of families through forests in Bosnia and Croatia. We drank rainwater, and slept behind rocks to hide. We saw bears and wolves,\u201d she says. \u201cIt lasted two and a half months.\u201d Finally she made it it to the UK, where she thought she would be treated fairly. And now she has got the fantastic news that she has been granted asylum. She hopes now that her son will be able to come to her. \u201cHe\u2019s 16 now. If he comes, we can make a new life here \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a firefighter here, but I will find some new work. \u201cI thank the Care4Calais volunteers for all their help while I have been here. They have been like angels to me with their kindness.\u201d If you can help us to help other refugees like Sani, please volunteer or donate at care4calais.org\/donate Pic: Daniela Sbrisny"}
