The four ladies eyed the backseat of my car with some scepticism as I explained it would be fine as long as they didn&#x2019;t mind a bit of a squish. There was another gentle sigh of resistance when I insisted everyone had to wear a seatbelt. My task was to ferry these ladies from their hotel to a free hair salon that Care4Calais had organised at a nearby church hall. One of the women &#x2013; a trained hairdresser herself &#x2013; was coming to help out, while the others were in search of a little pampering. The outward journey was quiet &#x2013; everyone was from a different country, and being forced to sit thigh-to-thigh in the backseat was a bit uncomfortable, but the ladies were polite, if a bit reserved. Soon, however, our pop-up salon worked its magic. A decent haircut and nice blow-dry can do wonders to restore the mood and put smiles back on everyone&#x2019;s faces. One of my passengers, an older lady from Sudan, was delighted. &#x2018;My happiest evening,&#x2019; she told me, her face wreathed in smiles as she patted her smooth hair. She even video-called her husband back home to show off her new hair-do. I was pulled into the camera frame to say hello and take some of the credit, though I&#x2019;d done little more than make tea and hand out pizza. I&#x2019;m always struck by how warm and friendly asylum seekers are, in spite of the horrors they&#x2019;ve endured. I think there&#x2019;s something about their culture and kinship that we&#x2019;ve lost sight of during our busy, urban lives. They call us volunteers &#x201C;sister&#x201D; or &#x201C;angel&#x201D; and are eager to share what little they have to show their gratitude &#x2013; be it a homemade Iranian delicacy, a bar of chocolate or a banana. On the return journey to the hotel, my little car was rocking with chatter and laughter. These ladies, strangers only a few hours ago, had become friends, bonded over hair straighteners and pizza. Now they were swapping numbers and hatching plans to do Zumba in each other&#x2019;s rooms. Watching them though my rear-view mirror, I felt my own bubble of happiness. This, I realised, is why we help. To share a smile, to become part of their wider family &#x2013; and to show that we care.
