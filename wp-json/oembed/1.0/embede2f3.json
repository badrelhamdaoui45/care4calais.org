Shon dreamed of being a pilot when he was a little boy growing up in Kenya. After leaving education there he worked in cyber security, and then had to flee to the UK. His dream went hold for a while, as he felt \u201cvery down\u201d when he arrived, but then he met a wonderful Care4Calais volunteer called Pauline. \u201cPauline encouraged to believe in the future again. Without her, I would not have been able to do anything. She is an angel.\u201d Eventually he was given permission to stay here, and began to do all sorts of jobs, from fork-lift driving to IT, all the time secretly saving up so he might be able to afford flying lessons. He somehow also found time to volunteer to help people suffering from addiction. He began flying this summer, and loves it. \u201cI love to look down and see the world. It looks so beautiful. I film it on my phone so I can watch later. \u201cIt\u2019s changed the way I see things. Up there you can see that things that look so big to us on the ground are really very small. Now I think of my challenges like that. They might feel big, but really they\u2019re tiny so I can overcome them. It gives me a really positive vibe.\u201d Shon would love to get his pilot\u2019s licence and fly passenger planes. In fact he feels that it\u2019s his life\u2019s calling, because it would mean \u201cI can take people safely from one place to another. I can\u2019t think what would be better. Freedom is paramount to me, and this is about freedom. \u201cI\u2019m not learning to fly just for me, that would be selfish. I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019d like to make a positive impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d Care4Calais volunteers like Pauline really do change people\u2019s lives every day.
