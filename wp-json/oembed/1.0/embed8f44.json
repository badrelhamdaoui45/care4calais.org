We have been working with a family of four refugees from Ukraine who are travelling with a disabled boy. They don\u2019t have any relatives in the UK, and I have been so worried about whether we would be able to help them. Roxy has become my friend and she has been so brave. She is only 22. A lot if reporters were asking me about her, so I suggested that she do an interview to explain her situation. We didn\u2019t know if this would help, but I thought it might be worth a try. Incredibly, a journalist called Joe from ITV got in touch to say that after they broadcast the interview, they heard from a family in the UK who have said they will welcome Roxy\u2019s family to their home. More than that, they have said that they will convert the hall and bathroom to make them accessible for Roman, her brother. We had a video call with the two families today, and it was unbelieveably moving. I felt so relieved and happy I can\u2019t put it into words. The British family were amazing &#8211; so kind and reassuring. They have five children of their own and their children are now looking forward to meeting Roxy\u2019s cat. Their generosity is simply beautiful. There have been so many times in the past when we haven\u2019t been able to find answers; to know that this time we might, and a refugee family will now be safe, feels truly wonderful. It\u2019s not over yet. Details of how the new sponsorship scheme will work have not been announced and there maybe legal barriers to overcome. But right now we have hope.
