Although he held out, keeping his head down and hanging onto his ambition as long as he could, he knew thart if he didn&#x2019;t leave, he would eventually be forced to join &#x201C;them&#x201D;. &nbsp; And so he packed his dreams and a few possessions, and set off to make the long journey to Europe, where he believed he would be able to lead the life he wished for. &nbsp; I met him in Calais when he settled with a few others around the &#x201C;English Learning station I was running on a distribution. &nbsp; Picking up books from the pile, they enthusiastically ran their fingers over English words that accompanied pictures and spelt out what they saw.&#xA0; &nbsp; Faisal pointed to his elbow and asked me hopefully, &#x201C;Eyebrow?&#x201D;&#xA0; &nbsp; &#x201C;Elbow&#x201D;, I said.&#xA0; &nbsp; &#x201C;I learn, but I forget. English not easy&#x201D;.&#xA0; &nbsp; He spent two hours sitting next to me, spelling out words, and reading out sentences. I downloaded an English-Pashto translator on my phone and we made some progress in learning sentences like, &#x201C;My English is not very good&#x201D;, &#x201C;I need to see a doctor&#x201D;, &#x201C;I want to call my family&#x201D;.&#xA0; &nbsp; Sentences he would need to use most frequently so he could survive in this new world. &nbsp; He told me the story of how he had left home overnight, and made his way from Taliban-occupied Afghanistan to Calais, via Iran, Turkey and Greece. It had been hard: once, he pointed to a big open wound on his right leg and to a few boys at the other end of park playing football. &#x201C;I like football,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but no play now&#x201D;. &nbsp; I had organised donations for Care4Calais over the past few years, but this was my first time at the camp and I was keen to make it count. Nothing could have prepared me for the faces, stories and lives that I saw at the make-shift camp in Calais that day. Young boys from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Sudan &#x2013; their full, normal lives as students, workers, part of happy families ravaged by war, famine, and takeover by the Taliban and so many other dangers. &nbsp; Over six hours at make-shift camps at Calais and Dunkirk that day and the next, my friend Aji and I must have met several hundred people. As we began packing up to get back to the warehouse on our lost day, it suddenly hit me that the semblance of a normal life the refugees had had over those few hours was on borrowed time.&#xA0; &nbsp; It me determined to go back again next year for a longer period. We must keep on trying, for the sake of Faisal and all those like him.</description></oembed>
