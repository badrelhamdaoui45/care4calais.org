As they know very well, the law allows refugees to come to the UK to claim asylum. A recent court of appeal ruling has shown that refugees coming to the UK on small boats are not arriving \u201cillegally\u201d if they intend to arrive at a port and claim asylum &#8211; which almost all of them do. In a court case on Thursday, Sir James Eadie QC, representing the home secretary, admitted to court that there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that \u201can illegal entry offence was always committed by passengers on small boats at the time.\u201d He said they now recognised the mistake. This followed the appeal ruling last December, when the judge said that the law had been \u201cmisunderstood\u201d by the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service, and that a legal \u201cheresy\u201d developed making asylum seekers believe they had no defence to the charge of facilitating illegal entry. \u201cAs the law presently stands,\u201d said Lord Justice Edie, \u201can asylum seeker who merely attempts to arrive at the frontiers of the United Kingdom in order to make a claim is not entering or attempting to enter the country unlawfully\u201d. The question, as Stuart McDonald the SNP MP asked in parliament two weeks ago, is why do ministers keep using the word \u201cillegal\u201d to describe refugees seeking asylum when it has been made plain that they are within the law? Describing refugees as \u201cillegal\u201d is incredibly dangerous. It criminalises a group of people who have in fact done nothing wrong, and has many harmful associations; most resonable people would believe that someone who is classed as \u201cillegal\u201d is somehow at fault and therefore not deserving of fair treatment. With respect to refugees, this is wholly wrong. In the case of Government ministers, the negative effects are multiplied. We assume (or used to) that ministers are telling the truth; in this case their statements may have contributed to a misapplication of the law. For this reason it is even more important that they are held to account. Read more here:\u00a0https:\/\/apple.news\/ARPU9mxE5SE2pJzYosmmp7A &nbsp;"}
