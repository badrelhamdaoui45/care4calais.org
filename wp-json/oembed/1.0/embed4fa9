Cases of malnutrition among both children and adults have been confirmed in various different areas of England, including hotels in London and in the south-west. Health professionals have raised concerns, with some children at hotels becoming dangerously thin and in need of frequent monitoring. One Syrian mother whom Care4Calais supports is in a London hotel with her family. &#x201C;Seeing my children lose weight in the hotel is breaking my heart. Children are supposed to gain weight as they grow not lose it.&#x201D; &#x201C;My three-year-old daughter has lost a lot of weight since we arrived. She only weighs 13 kilos now. When we ask for milk for the children they don&#x2019;t always give it to us and the milk we do get looks like it&#x2019;s mixed with water. We&#x2019;re given rice swimming in water and stinky chicken.&#x201D; &nbsp; Those working with families in hotels reported that some parents have been found rummaging through bins to find food for their children and adults were losing as much as 10-15kg (22-33lbs) of weight.</description></oembed>
