That way, you will find your dream.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0; In December 2017 a young Syrian refugee arrived at Glasgow Airport. People smugglers had brought him there, but he didn&#x2019;t know where he was, and asked the Border Control guards who had detained him if he could walk into London to buy some food, as he was hungry. &#x201C;I guess it broke the ice, as they all laughed. They said that would be fine, if I had about five days to spare.&#x201D; When he finally made it into Glasgow itself, he was bowled over. &#x201C;I loved the city. It was so beautifully friendly, and although I was homeless there were lots of places that helped me. When I arrived I had no English, so I set about learning it. I watched The Vampire Diaries on TV, and finding it so much fun to watch I learned a lot of English from it. After that, I started to learn some funny English slang, like like &#x2018;hunky dory&#x2019; and &#x2018;alright mate?&#x2019; &#x201C;After a few months in Glasgow I was moved to London, and I lived in a hostel. And it was there that my story really begins. &#x201C;One night I was just flicking through YouTube and I stumbled across a video of a guy swimming. He looked as if he was flying through the water, with nothing stopping him. I watched more of his videos, and something just got caught hold of me, and I knew what I wanted to do. I was going to be a swimmer; I was going to be the next Michael Phelps and I was going to go to the Olympics! I was 23 at the time. There was just one small problem in that I couldn&#x2019;t swim, but hey, you&#x2019;ve got to start somewhere. &#x201C;It was a bit odd I chose swimming I suppose, because I nearly died in a boat crossing the Mediterranean. That was a really terrifying experience, and I&#x2019;ve only swum in the sea once, since then &#x2013; I prefer pools. &#x201C;Anyway, I got some swimming trunks and I went to the pool. I couldn&#x2019;t afford lessons so I hung about in the corners of pools watching the trainers. I&#x2019;m actually surprised I wasn&#x2019;t arrested now I think about it! I copied the swimmers and some of the trainers noticed me and I explained what I was doing. Some invited me to join the groups. But mostly I taught myself. &#x201C;Living on &#xA3;5 a day as a refugee was very tough. It really doesn&#x2019;t go very far, but I didn&#x2019;t let it stop me swimming. People asked me why I bothered with swimming when I had barely enough to feed myself, but you have to have a dream or a purpose, because that&#x2019;s what keeps you going.&#xA0; &#x201C;I learned to swim.&#xA0; I am a sprinter mainly &#x2013; freestyle &#x2013; but I like Butterfly too. I got better. I watched videos, and went to the pool every day and I became fast. The trainer was actually amazed. I started to win races, progressing to bigger and bigger ones. I dream of qualifying to swim in the olympics ones day.&#xA0; &#x201C;I have been supported by so many people, and my story has even been mentioned in parliament! I was in the YMCA for a year before my asylum was granted, now I live with an amazing family I met while I was at the YMCA. We became friends and eventually I moved into their house. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve not just been learning to swim though; I&#x2019;ve just completed my foundation year for my bachelor&#x2019;s degree in accounting and finance from Kings College London. t is so tough doing a degree in a second language. I&#x2019;m still learning English, and this has been a big challenge for me, but I&#x2019;ve just completed my first year exams in English.&#xA0; &#x201C;I have also worked as an intern at Convex, an insurance and finance company in London, but I always train at least four hours a day. I still need to get a bit faster on my time, but I&#x2019;ll get there. &#x201C;I had a wonderful life in Syria, a good job and a home, but that is gone. There is no home to go back to for me. Some of my family are still there. I will see them again when the war is over.&#xA0; London is my home now and I love it, you have to look forward and focus on what you want, and be positive.&#xA0; &#x201C;In London, I love Camden Market and Covent Garden, the theatre and Portobello Road. I&#x2019;m a city boy, for sure and I want to make my life here. Most of all I want to go to the olympics, and swim for the refugee team.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &nbsp;</description></oembed>
