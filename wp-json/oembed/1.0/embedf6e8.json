I\u2019m from an old-fashioned, very strict Muslim family in Iran, and when I changed my religion to Christian, my father and brother had a big problem with me. My mum said, \u201cSani, listen to me. He wants to kill you because he doesn\u2019t like women working, he doesn\u2019t like women changing their ideas, he doesn\u2019t like women talking to men.\u201d But I had to talk to men at my work. I was a firefighter. It really all started when my husband divorced me. I was depressed and stayed at home for six years, but then I got my job, and I realised I didn\u2019t want to follow my family\u2019s old ideas. Lady can\u2019t swim, lady can\u2019t go out alone, lady can\u2019t be too happy because it\u2019s not good for her, blah blah blah. But the men in my family didn\u2019t like me thinking like this, and when I realised they wanted to kill me, I had to leave. I had a teenage son from my marriage, and I had to leave him with my family. So I headed for London because I thought it would be safe there. I went to Turkey, then Greece and then walked with a group of families through forests in Bosnia and Croatia. We drank rainwater, and slept behind rocks to hide. We saw bears and wolves. It lasted two and a half months. Then we met a smuggler and he took us to northern France, or Belgium, I\u2019m not sure. In October I got on a boat to the UK. As he pushed us off early one morning, the smuggler warned us that if we came back he would kill us and bury us in the woods. Then as soon as we were out on the sea we saw a big ship coming towards us; I thought I was going to be minced beef going through its propeller. One man went crazy and started unscrewing the cap to let the air out of the dinghy. \u201cYou are crazy!\u201d I shouted. \u201cPut that back! We drove right across the Channel and landed on the shore, and the police picked us up. I\u2019ve been in London since then, waiting for an asylum interview. At first I was in shock and couldn\u2019t talk to anyone, but now I go walking, I do some fitness, I\u2019m learning English. I hope so much that I get asylum, because then my son will be able to come to me. He\u2019s 16 now. My brother shouts at him a lot, and he leaves home sometimes. If he comes, we can make a new life here where we are safe \u2013 I don\u2019t think I will be a firefighter here, but I will find something. We have only one chance at this life, not two, so I want to forget the past, and look forward. #RefugeeWeek2021"}
