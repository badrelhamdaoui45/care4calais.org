I don&#x2019;t know if my dad&#x2019;s alive or dead. I came from Eritrea, but I&#x2019;ve been travelling for so many years now. The thing that has really kept me alive is my dream of being an artist. Do you mind if I don&#x2019;t tell you all the details of my story in Eritrea? It makes me feel bad to remember it. I can tell you that it was my mum that made our family leave, when I was small. She is my hero. And yet, I don&#x2019;t see her any more. We spent time in Ethiopia before I set out on my own for Sudan. I passed through Egypt and finally made it to northern France. It was my wish to come to London; I knew people would be open, and accept me here. And I always dreamed of seeing all the famous art galleries in the city, of seeing the famous paintings I had heard about, and of taking proper art lessons. I&#x2019;ve been drawing and painting since I was about ten. It is something I have to do, and I feel only half alive when I cannot make art. It is like breathing fresh air. I&#x2019;m just self taught though, I&#x2019;ve not been to college or studied it. I drew and painted as I travelled, and when I made it to the Jungle in Calais, I painted a lot there as I waited and waited to find a way to get to the UK. I never sold my pictures for money but sometimes I would get food or a place to stay in exchange. I used to paint at the big Eritrean Church in the camp, until it was destroyed. These tattoos were done in exchange for some of my paintings. A lot of my pictures are still in Calais. I was stuck there, living on the streets for nearly four years. I couldn&#x2019;t get a boat, and sometimes you just don&#x2019;t find the right lorry. It takes time. By the end I was not in a good way mentally or physically; I know people who met me thought I might not survive another winter. But I never gave up, and I held on to my dream of getting to the UK. In March this year, I finally made it over. Now I&#x2019;m living in Lewisham in south London. London is everything I thought it would be, the best city in the world! I know there are people here who do not want us refugees, but so far I have not met any. I have so many friends, people I met in Calais over the years. I know many Care4Calais volunteers, they are my friends. Everyone is so open and accepting, as I hoped they would be. Right now I like to paint realistic pictures, you know, landscapes and people on really big canvases. I like to stand up and paint, big movements and big dreams. I&#x2019;m not painting right now as I&#x2019;ve run out of supplies, and there really isn&#x2019;t any room in the hostel I am in. I guess that&#x2019;s another dream, to find a space for a studio or an easel at least. I want to visit all the London galleries, and really get started painting. When I get my interview and asylum, Inshallah, I want to sign up for art classes, maybe even university or college. Right now I&#x2019;m just enjoying being here in the UK, being safe and having somewhere to sleep. It&#x2019;s a good feeling being here, and I enjoy seeing all the things in London. Maybe soon I&#x2019;ll paint them too. ##refugeeweek2021</description></oembed>
