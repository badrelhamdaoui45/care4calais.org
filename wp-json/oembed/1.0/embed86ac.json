Steve joins us after seven years as Chief Executive of the International Refugee Trust, and prior to that being Chief Executive of Action on Armed Violence. Steve has worked all over the world, frequently in conflict and disaster zones where he has coordinated responses to significant movements of refugees, including the Vietnamese boat people and Kosovars during the Kosovo crisis. He also managed the UK\u2019s aid response to the 1988 Nepal earthquake. He sits on the Board of Keeping Children Safe. Steve said: &#8220;Refugees are desperate for a safe place they can call home. As the new CEO at Care4Calais, I shall do all in my power to ensure they have just that. &#8220;I am taking on this mantle from the charity&#8217;s founder, Clare. I have big shoes to fill, but I&#8217;m up for the challenge. I am looking forward to working with the thousands of Care4Calais volunteers who make a difference to the lives of refugees every day.\u201d Clare Moseley will take over from Sue Jex as Chair of Trustees. Sue is stepping down as chair but remains a committed member of the Board of Trustees."}
