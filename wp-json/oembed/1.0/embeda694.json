Kamal, a 22-year-old Sudanese refugee whose been in detention for two months under threat of being sent to Rwanda, has finally been freed. For two months Kamal has lived in constant fear and anxiety as he worried about was going to happen to him. He knows of atrocities committed by the regime in Rwanda, and even now he\u2019s been released, the thought of being sent there makes him physically shake.\u00a0 It will probably give him nightmares for months. \u201cI spent 18 months travelling through Africa trying to find a way out. In every country I\u2019ve been beaten, robbed and treated as sub-human, so why on Earth would I want to go back to Rwanda?\u201d Being free feels wonderful, he says, but he still feels weak, and his ordeal as a refugee isn\u2019t over yet, because he still has to go through his asylum claim. But at least now he can begin to think about beginning his life again. He is so polite with such a big smile and an excellent sense of humour, and we really hope that he has a good, safe future ahead of him. His problems began in Darfur many years ago \u2013 pretty much from the day he was born. \u201cThe problems in Darfur aren\u2019t just because of the war. It\u2019s always been hard for blacks. The Arabs of the north treat us like animals and make life very tough. We cannot find jobs or finish our education, and university is almost impossible. Even just walking down the street is dangerous \u2013 they will stop you and beat you and take your phone or anything you may have. If you won\u2019t give it to them they will use a gun to force you. In Darfur there is no hope, no future, no peace and no safety. \u201cSudanese people are beautiful, they are so kind and peaceful but there is nothing for us. It is controlled by the north and we are treated like slaves. \u201cI was from a large family and there was never enough money. I used to help my mum in whatever work we could find. It was always low-level work in the markets, moving things and selling things. We would do anything to get money to eat. \u201cAfter primary school I was denied education but later when I was 18 or 19 I started to join campaigns to demand education and to be allowed to go to college. We demonstrated outside the university even though the police beat us and put us in jail. \u201cGradually I realised\u00a0 things would only get worse and I\u2019d never have a chance to learn. With some others we decided to leave and so in December 2020 I started my journey. \u201cWe began by heading into Chad. That was better than the desert to Libya, but still not good. There was a war there, so it was a dangerous place for us. We looked for a small town to find a job, but we couldn\u2019t find work anywhere. Finally we heard about some men who were digging for gold somewhere between Libya and Niger, so we went there. \u201cThe digging was hard work outside in the sun, but after a long search we found rocks containing gold and dug them out. Some other experienced men took the good rocks away to be cleaned and washed, so the gold could be extracted. They told us we had found a good place and to keep working. But after two months hard work they refused to pay us. \u201cBy then we had nothing, and we were forced to continue work. We worked many hours with no rests and so little food. The hammers we used weighed 10 kilos and it was so hot. I didn\u2019t think I could survive so I planned to escape. \u201cFour of us escaped. We split up so they could not find us easily, and I went into Niger to look for a job. There was nothing, though, no jobs and no money. After some time I decided\u00a0 I had to go to Libya; I was lucky there I suppose, as I was never caught and put in prison, but I think that\u2019s\u00a0 maybe because I had such a bad time digging the gold. \u201cI found a smuggler and persuaded him to take what little money I had and let me on a boat. The boat headed to Lampedusa, but it took four days to get there, and the journey was very scary. There was no food or water on the boat and the waves were very high; by the fourth day the boat was finished, and the waves were crashing down on it making it sink. Luckily we were near the island by now and could get a network signal. A boat came to rescue us and took us to shore. \u201cI tried to get a train to Rome with my friend but we couldn\u2019t afford tickets and we kept getting caught. But then an Italian lady helped us \u2013 she bought us tickets to Rome and took us to her house to sleep and to eat. You find kindness when you least expect it. \u201cFrom Rome we went to Ventimiglia, but again I had no money for a smuggler. There were lots of guys living under a bridge there and a charity that gave us food and water. Some of these guys were getting a car to France with a smuggler. It was only $40 to pay but I didn\u2019t even have that, but I managed to get in unnoticed. I wasn\u2019t found and got to France. \u201cFrom the border I travelled to Marseille and then Paris. In Paris I had to sleep on the street for two days, I had no phone and no money. Again I found a kind man who lent me his phone so I could call my friends to make a plan. We decided to meet in Calais to try to cross [&hellip;]"}
