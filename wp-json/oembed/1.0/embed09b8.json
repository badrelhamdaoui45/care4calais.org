And yesterday my heart was touched in a way I can\u2019t even explain when I met three-year-old Sanam and her mum. Sanam\u2019s mum sat in the chair to have her hair cut by Lucy, our volunteer hairdresser, and Sanam smiled as I passed a toy car back and forth with her. Then Sanam herself sat down, and let Lucy cut her hair too. As conversation flowed between us, Sanam\u2019s mum explained why her dad wasn\u2019t with them. Back in Afghanistan he had been a police officer; three months ago, he had been killed by men from the Taliban. Since then, Sanam has had nightmares that the Taliban are coming for her. Her mum tries to calm her by letting her know that they\u2019re now in a safe place together. When the haircuts were finished, they asked us if we had a hairbrush we could give them. I told her I\u2019d get one, and added it to the list of items we need. The need for such small, peveryday things is a reminder of how quickly they had to get out of their homes and leave their country, with no time to pack what we in the UK consider daily essentials. \u2800\u2800 Sanam and her mum thanked us as they left, and headed back to their temporary hotel room to wait for Care4Calais\u2019 distribution of clothes and toiletries the following day. I met many women and children yesterday with similar stories to Sanam\u2019s; meeting people who fled Afghanistan really puts life into perspective. \u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800 Lucy did such a wonderful job. She is a young hairdresser who\u2019d had a few days free, and offered to give this time to help Care4Calais so that some women and children could have their hair tidied. It made me think about how precious time is, and what an important effect it can have. Helping one person might not change the whole world, but it could change the world for one person, and that has a ripple effect that flows\u2026 \u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800 Personally I don\u2019t have much time to spare between being a mum to three kids, teaching yoga classes and running a business. But yesterday in that hotel I really felt that the time I\u2019ve put in as a volunteer for Care4Calais has certainly not been wasted. \u2800\u2800 To volunteer or donate go to\u00a0Care4Calais.org"}
