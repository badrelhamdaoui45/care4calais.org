This will be an incredibly important case for the future refugee rights in the UK. Our lawyers will argue: &#8211; There is compelling evidence, provided by UNHCR, that Rwanda is not a safe country for refugees. &#8211; There is a risk that refugees human rights may be breached in Rwanda. &#8211; It is against international refugee law to penalise refugees for their unlawful arrival in a country. &#8211; UNHCR have provided evidence that asylum seekers will not get a fair hearing in Rwanda. &#8211; The procedure that has been used to decide to send people to Rwanda may not have been fair. We are currently working with 24 people who have been detained and issued with notices since the last court case, and many of those from last time still remain in detention now. We heard today that the first woman has been detained and issued with a Rwanda notice. We also understand that a second flight is now being prepared, a source of great fear for all those at risk. We need your help to show the Government this is not what British people want. Please act now. Here\u2019s what you can do: Download the icon and save it as your profile picture on social media =&gt; bit.ly\/RWDicon Download or make a #StopRwanda card and take picture of yourself and\/or your friends holding it.
