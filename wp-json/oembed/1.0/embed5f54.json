This photograph of refugees and Care4Calais volunteers has been chosen for a government ad campaign that shows what makes Britain Great \u2013 and will soon be prominently displayed at Heathrow Airport. The picture was taken by photographer Frederic Aranda, who works with a group based at an East London hotel. Frederic loves the way volunteers and refugees come together as a big family, and tried to get that across in his pictures. He certainly succeeded in this one, shot in London\u2019s Smithfield market. \u201cThe image is a tribute to Care4Calais, an organisation that helps refugees whose immigration status is in limbo as a result of restrictive government policy,\u201d says Monocle magazine in this story about the ad. \u201cLaunched in 2012, during the London Olympics and Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, the aim of the \u00a3125m (\u20ac150m) campaign is to increase tourism from a number of crucial markets, including India, China and Japan. However, the most salient effect of the ads \u2013 bearing pictures of Harry Potter and Buckingham Palace guardsmen with \u201cGREAT\u201d emblazoned across them \u2013 was to make Brits returning home from abroad cringe their way through passport control. \u201cPerhaps mindful of its painful uncoolness, the campaign launched a competition alongside the Royal Photographic Society and Heathrow Airport for new images to be displayed at the UK\u2019s largest airport.\u201d Frederic\u2019s picture was one of the winning entries. Most people shown were waiting on asylum applications when it was taken, and its use at Heathrow is wonderful statement that refugees are welcome here. At a time when the Home Secretary is shamefully trying to send them to Rwanda, its selection shows that at least some people in government understand the importance of welcoming refugees to the United Kingdom. Frederic, by the way, has donated his prize money to each of the refugees in the picture. As Monocle says \u2013 that\u2019s truly great. https:\/\/monocle.com\/minute\/2022\/04\/23\/pride-of-the-nation\/?c=Weekend\/"}
