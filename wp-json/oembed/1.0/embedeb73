Was it worth it now everything&#x2019;s gone? It&#x2019;s a really hard thing to stomach when you look at everything we sacrificed and lost so that we could have a future for our children, and then saw that future ripped from us. I worked with the British Special Forces. I was with the Afghani Special Forces Commando, and being out there on the front line I saw what was coming, and I knew I would be one of the first targets. I applied for the ARAP scheme as soon as it opened, and I left Afghanistan early in July. It wasn&#x2019;t as organized as that makes it sound, because when the Taliban took the outskirts of Kabul I had to leave immediately. There was no time to get my wife and six children &#x2013; two boys and four girls &#x2013; out, so they&#x2019;re still there in Kabul waiting to leave. I talk to them every day, and they&#x2019;re as safe as they can be. They don&#x2019;t live at home, but move from house to house trying to stay out of the Taliban&#x2019;s sight. My girls are still in school when they can be, but they have to keep moving schools too. This is becoming normal &#x2013; no one questions who comes to school, unless the Taliban are there. But then if the Taliban are there, the girls do not go to school. Everything is getting harder. There&#x2019;s no money and no jobs, and everything is collapsing. My family is registered to come to the UK, but I don&#x2019;t know when it will happen, and it is impossible to find anyone who can tell me. I have confidence in the British to get my family out, though; they looked after us in the army, so I hope they keep their promises. When I first arrived in the UK I was sent to a hotel in London. I didn&#x2019;t know anyone there though, so I asked if I could go to stay with my cousins in Manchester. I was allowed to do this. My cousin knew about Care4Calais, and said they would help me find some clothes, so I went to meet them at a hotel where they were doing a distribution. I got talking to the volunteers, and one day I found they needed a lot of help moving boxes, so I did this for them. I much prefer to work than sit around. In Afghanistan I was very busy with my job. I worked in Helmand, Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad, always on special missions on the front line. I was a major in the Quick Reaction Team (QRT). If you&#x2019;ve watched The OutPost on Amazon you&#x2019;ll know the sort of thing I did. We&#x2019;d be flown in for 72 hours or less and have to move back out quickly, so we couldn&#x2019;t be found. By June we were surrounded, and I knew we couldn&#x2019;t do anything when America left; I saw it happen, and I knew that was the end. I knew there would be nowhere to hide, and I knew that I was a major target. If I stayed, they would have been able to use my family to make me surrender. I had no choice. I spent some time training other soldiers in the Afghan army. I really enjoyed this, and I thought we were making progress in making a good army that could keep Afghanistan safe. I miss the army and my friends both Afghan and British, but I do like Manchester and its people. They are very friendly. Back in Afghanistan I liked to play volleyball and chess; I was pretty good at chess, and it would be good to find someone to play with here. Right now I just play online, which is OK but it would be good to sit outside with chai and play for real. I think that would help me learn English faster too!
