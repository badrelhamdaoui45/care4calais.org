Tragically, at 6:30pm last night, a TER train to Calais hit a group of Eritrean refugees. This instantly killed one and has left three serious injured &#x2013; one an &#x201C;absolute emergency&#x201D; condition. This is the FIFTH official Channel related death in under two weeks. At least one refugee drowned last Tuesday after his boat capsized, another body was found off Dunkirk on Wednesday and one person was found dead on a beach near Calais this morning (close by: a boat filled with water). And on October 23, we also reported the devastating lorry death of yet another refugee. This seriously, may be the worse Calais has ever been. Mr Dhersin, spokesman for the local French council, has said there will only be &#x201C;more and more accidents and incidents.&#x201D; But how many more accidents and incidents will it take for the UK Government to offer refugees a safe and dignified passage to claim asylum in the UK? How many more days of hunger strikes (the Priest is on day 26)? Instead, Priti Patel offers France &#xA3;54million to step up Channel patrols and authorises deadly &#x2018;pushback&#x2019; tactics. Drownings. Trains. A bitter winter. Refugees have overcome everything to reach safety &#x2013; but for some, these final, unnecessary hurdles are what will lead them to their deaths. This cannot and should not be ignored &#x2013; if you agree, please share this post and/or pledge to have a conversation about this with somebody today. Together &#x2013; we will spread what our Government is choosing to ignore. And sign up to our newsletter for further updates: care4calais.org/newsletter/</description></oembed>
