He had lived in London for five years, waiting on a decision on his asylum claim, when glaucoma in one eye began to damage his eyesight. Unfortunately, hospital treatments didn\u2019t work, and then a problem with his other eye, has left him severely sight-impaired. He tries to stay active, but his eyesight is getting worse. The Home Office housed Paul in an east London hotel 14 months ago. At first he felt very depressed and isolated there, but then he discovered the Care4Calais group for refugees housed in the hotel; in particular he met a refugee from Nigeria known as \u201cChief\u201d. Every Saturday the group went on a guided walk around London. Paul didn\u2019t feel able to go because of his eyesight, but one morning Chief offered to guide him. Paul accepted, and as they walked around, they got along really well. Watching them, you can see Chief has a great, calm manner, and just seems to know what Paul needs when he needs it. The two of them have become close friends now, and you rarely see one without the other. \u201cIt was like having someone from your family to help,\u201d Paul remembers. \u201cBut that\u2019s what the group is like &#8211; a big family. Some of us have each other\u2019s numbers so we can call and talk, sometimes people just come to take me out for a walk. The volunteers are like family too. Rosemary, one of them, calls me to see how I\u2019m doing. \u201cBecause of Chief and the others I\u2019m not depressed any more. I look forward to every Saturday.\u201d Everyone at Care4Calais was delighted when after years of waiting, Paul recently got leave to remain; he can now start to rebuild his life. \u201cCare4Calais groups can foster a small communities where refugees and volunteers build confidence and dignity,\u201d says Rosemary. \u201cPaul and Chief capture that. It makes me really happy and proud to be a volunteer.\u201d We need more kindness like Chief and Paul\u2019s in the world.
