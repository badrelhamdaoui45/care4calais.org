Originally from Yemen, his story is one of the most brutal I have heard. He has been in the UK for one year, lives in a hostel, and has no ID. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel at home like this\u201d he often said. Last week Goods For Good donated some Nike clothing to our team in London. Amongst them was this Official England windbreaker which I gave to Faisal as the weather was wet. Today when I met him he explained that all week people had been talking to him, waving to him , giving thumbs up and high fives when they saw the Three Lions emblem. . In addition to this, Faisal left his phone on a bus and a very kind woman found it and returned it to him. \u201cThis week\u201d, he said \u201cI felt good here in the UK\u201d We\u2019ve all heard the phrase \u201c football\u2019s coming home.\u201d Let\u2019s hope England win. If they don\u2019t, well, I\u2019m just as delighted, that thanks to a generous jacket donation, sporting camaraderie and an unknown woman who found his phone, Faisal at last felt at home. &#8211; Matilda Wither Velevitch volunteer #refugeeswelcome #care4calais #nike #goods4good #community #football #ComingHome"}
